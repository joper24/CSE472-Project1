 This website helps people with illnesses and disabilities participate in Black Lives Matter protests. It also provides a platform for people to share and discuss their experiences and to build a network of support.<|endoftext|>The US Supreme Court handed down a decision Tuesday that will have a profound impact on how the country's criminal justice system deals with police misconduct cases. The justices ruled that police officers' First Amendment rights protect them from being compelled to testify in court, but that does not mean they are immune from charges of misconduct. The decision means that officers may not testify in court in cases where they have a duty to protect themselves or others. Here's what you need to know. What the decision means The decision means that the police officers who used deadly force in Ferguson, Missouri, last August will now be able to use deadly force in cases where they have a duty to protect themselves or others. In theory, that means police officers in those cases would no longer have to fear that their actions could be construed as "contemptuous" or "unreasonable." But it could also mean that police officers in some other situations could be held accountable for the actions of their officers, even though they didn't intend to kill a person. What the court said The decision in the case of the police officers involved in the fatal shooting of Michael Brown was a victory for those who said the police officers' First Amendment rights protected them from being held liable for the actions of their colleagues. But it also means that officers who kill people in police encounters could be held accountable for their actions. "It is a victory for the First Amendment, but it's a victory for the officers involved in the killing of Michael Brown and for the communities he served," said Jamie Fellner, a Ferguson activist who was not involved in the case. "It's a victory for the Constitution, but it also means that we're going to have to reevaluate the way we police

 The police department's decision to release the video -- which shows Floyd being arrested -- was a decision made by the department in a "holistic" investigation, Chief David Brown said Tuesday. The video shows Floyd pleading for help as he is handcuffed and taken to the ground by officers. He is then seen bleeding profusely as officers attempt to restrain him. Floyd died shortly after being taken to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead, police said. The police department has not said why Floyd died. CNN has not been able to reach the officers for comment. The video begins with Floyd being arrested for resisting arrest and has a black and white view of the arrest. It then cuts to a white view of a medical examiner's report, showing Floyd's injuries consistent with a choke hold. CNN has not been able to reach the officers for comment. The video ends with an officer saying, "He's dead." The officers are seen on the video standing over Floyd and he is seen being taken into custody. The police department has said Floyd died from a gunshot wound to the head. Floyd was arrested in April. He was found dead on the side of the road shortly after, police said. The autopsy report says Floyd was "shot multiple times from a close range point of view" and "shot multiple times through his left front left chest cavity." An autopsy found Floyd had methamphetamine in his system, the Hialeah police said. CNN has not been able to reach the officers for comment.
 The video shows Floyd, who was black, lying on the ground handcuffed, face down in the middle of the road, with his eyes shut, according to a criminal complaint filed Tuesday by the attorney representing the family of Floyd, John Burleson. The attorney's statement says Burleson was not aware that Floyd was wearing a seat belt when he was shot. Burleson is white. The suit alleges that the officers' actions were "willful and malicious" and that they acted "willfully and knowingly" to "inflict emotional distress upon Mr. Floyd." "These officers' actions were calculated to cause and prolong the suffering of Mr. Floyd's family and to deprive them of a fair trial," Burleson's attorney, John Morgan, said in a statement. The officers involved in the shooting of Floyd, who have not been identified, have been placed on administrative leave, the South Florida Police Department said. "

 Public support for the Black Lives Matter movement has dropped since June, report finds. Meanwhile, the number of Black Americans who say the police are doing a good job has increased from 35% in June 2016 to 49% in a new CNN/ORC poll. It's a change that's been driven in part by increased support for Black Lives Matter. "It's not surprising that the black community is seeing more positive messages from the media and politicians about police officers," said Randal O'Toole, a professor of African-American studies at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. "The public's response to the unrest in Ferguson has been to push for more police involvement in the community and to demand justice for those killed by police."
 The city's police chief said the decision to fire Wilson was "not the right decision" and that he would "look at all options to resolve this matter." "Our officers have done what they have to protect themselves and their communities, and I believe the actions of our police officers were appropriate and consistent with our commitment to the safety of our citizens," Police Chief Gary W. Wilson said in a statement. "I am confident that we can all agree that there are things we all can agree on -- that our community can agree on -- and that is that there must be a full investigation of this incident." The Ferguson Police Department has been under fire since the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown in August of 2014, and the resulting protests and national attention have brought racial tensions to the fore. Protesters have called for justice in the killing of Brown and for the formation of a police oversight board to oversee the department. "The Black Lives Matter movement has had a great impact on the conversation and change in Ferguson," said James E. O'Neill Jr., a political science professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. "The Black Lives Matter protests have brought about a lot of change in how we see the police department, but what's missing is the critical component that Ferguson needs -- the police officer." O

 When we think about the history of race relations in this country, we often think of the 18th and 19th centuries. The "Bloody Sunday" clashes between whites and black Americans were a defining moment in American history. But there's another moment that we often ignore: the 1960s. And that's when the Civil Rights movement began. The 1960s were a pivotal moment in the history of race relations in the United States. It was the beginning of the Black Lives Matter movement and the beginning of the era of "law and order" politics that we're still seeing today. So what happened in the 1960s is a topic for historians, sociologists and activists to discuss. But to talk about it in depth, it helps to look at the broader context in which it happened. So let's start with an overview of the Civil Rights Movement in the US. The '60s and '70s The Civil Rights Movement started in the summer of 1964 with the assassination of four civil rights workers, and it snowballed into a nationwide movement. In the early days, it was mainly young people coming out to protest the Vietnam War and the assassinations of civil rights workers like MLK Jr. But as the movement grew, so did the numbers of people involved. By the mid-1970s, the number of protesters had more than doubled to more than 8 million people. The movement gained momentum when police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds in the city of Selma, Alabama. A year later, police killed 36 people, most of them black residents of Selma. In the late '70s and early '80s, protests were also seen in cities like Minneapolis and New York City. But the focus shifted to other issues, such as police brutality and the decline of the civil rights movement. By the mid-1990s, the number of protests had more than doubled to more than 50 million people. But it wasn't until 2009, when protests surpassed 50 million people. The surge in protests coincided with the Black Lives Matter movement. The movement became a major topic of conversation and discussion turned to the meaning of blackness. Some say the focus on blackness and social justice is a direct result of the protests, but others say the Black Lives Matter movement has contributed to the decline of the civil rights movement. How many protests was it during the 1960s? The numbers may be hard to come by, but the New York Times estimates there were between 10.4 and 20 million protests during the 1960s and early 1970s. In the 1980s, the numbers were closer to 20 million protests. The numbers have been declining since the mid-2000s. The numbers peaked in the early 1980s and have declined ever since. In the 1960s, there were some of the most significant protests in American history, such as the sit-ins at the University of Missouri-St. Louis and the Million Man March. But protests have been largely forgotten these days. In the 1970s, protests were overshadowed by the Black Power movement, but it wasn't until the 1980s that the movement gained traction. In the 1990s and 2000s, protests became a major topic of conversation and discussion turned to the meaning of blackness and social justice.  But the protests of the 1960s and 1970s have largely been forgotten.  In the 1980s and 1990s, protests were largely about economic issues, such as the Vietnam War and the rise of Black Lives Matter. But the movement has also drawn attention to issues of race, gender and social justice. How many protests was it during the 1960s? It depends on who you ask.  The New York Times estimates there were between 3.8 and 10.9 million protests during the 1960s and 1970s. But the numbers have declined since then. In the 1980s and 1990s, the numbers were closer to 4.8 million. In the 2000s, the numbers were closer to 5.2 million.  So it's not surprising that the number of protests during the 1960s is dwarfed by the number in the present day. What are the implications? This is why the Civil Rights Movement has been called the most important civil rights movement in US history. It was a watershed moment in American history

 A White police chief lays out why Black Lives Matter protests matter in small towns and urban areas of the US. Here's what you need to know. What's at stake? The White House and the Capitol Hill are both controlled by Republicans. So is the White House. If the White House and the Capitol Hill vote to defund Planned Parenthood, the fallout could be even more dire for Republicans in Congress. The White House could lose the power to defund Planned Parenthood, a move that would effectively end federal funding for the group. This could lead to a government shutdown and possibly even a government default. What happens next? The White House says it will call up the American Health Care Act, a Republican-led bill that would dismantle the Affordable Care Act. The bill would replace the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate with a "public option" that would encourage people to get coverage. But the AHCA faces some hurdles in the Senate, where Democrats are united in opposition. Republicans plan to hold a vote next week on a budget resolution that would keep the government open through September.
 The gunman killed five officers and wounded eight others Thursday night at a Dallas protest over the police killing of Philando Castile, a black man. What happened next was seen from several miles away. Police said the gunman was "disturbed" by the violence and decided to go back to his apartment. But a neighbor who said she saw the suspect in the apartment said he didn't seem upset. "He just stood there, he was upset," the woman said. "He walked out the front door and he didn't come back inside." A woman who lives near the scene of the shooting told CNN that the man's apartment had been broken into and that the man had been there for a few days. She said she didn't see him during the protests and that he didn't smoke. "I heard a guy screaming 'I love black people' and that kind of stuff," she said. "He was just screaming 'I love black people' and stuff like that." The woman said that she was not surprised by the violence. "It's just the beginning," she said. "It's going to be a long night." 'Black lives matter' The shooting death of Castile, a father of six, was captured on video by two bystanders. The video shows the 32-year-old father of six, who was a devout Catholic, with a large blood vessel in his lung. It's a condition that can lead to respiratory issues and even death. He was shot by police during a traffic stop. He was unarmed. The video, which was released Monday, was viewed more than 500,000 times on Facebook and more than 800,000 times on Twitter. It was also shared widely on Instagram and Snapchat. The aftermath of the shooting was seen from several miles away. Police said they found a loaded gun in the man's apartment. The man has not been identified. The man was shot by police, but it's not clear whether he was carrying a weapon, police said. Officers had used tear gas, but they were unsuccessful in getting the man to stop, police said. Protesters have been demanding justice for Castile, who was shot by a police officer on Thursday night. They have also been demanding that the city of Dallas release dashcam video that shows the aftermath of the shooting. The city has not released the video.
 "I'm glad that he was not killed by the police officers. It would have been a tragedy," said Miguel Angel Ortiz, a Mexican American, who lives just blocks away from where the shooting took place. Ortiz said he doesn't know why the man was wearing a mask, but he said it was obvious that the man was nervous. Ortiz said he was shocked by the number of officers involved in the shooting, but he felt they should have been more careful. "It's not right," he said. "It's not right that he was shot by the police." Ortiz said that he felt like he was in a war zone. "I have to be honest with you," he said. "I'm glad that he was not killed by the police." Police Chief David Brown said that officers had to make split-second decisions. "That's not the way that we do things in the police department," he said. "That's not how we treat our citizens." Brown said that the officers' actions were not consistent with the way they were trained. "They were not trained to make split-second decisions," he said. "They made split-second decisions. They chose to shoot." The officers' actions were "not consistent with our values," he said. "That's not the way that we do things in this department." He said that he felt the officers were protecting themselves. "I am not a racist," he said. "I am a person of color." The mayor said that the city will hold a candlelight vigil Thursday night at 6:30 p.m. ET. The city is holding a candlelight rally at the same location where a man

 The protesters' demands include the creation of a central database of police shootings, the reinstatement of the "stand your ground" law and the protection of the right to protest. The decision to call off the protests came after intense negotiations with police and city officials, the New York Times reported. The city and the NYPD initially said they would not issue permits to protest, but the city and the NYPD announced Wednesday that they will be issuing permits later this week. "I am pleased that our community is once again engaged in peaceful protest and we are making progress toward a just and lasting solution to the systemic racism that has plagued our city for decades," NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill said. "The NYPD and City Council are working together to make sure that peaceful protest is not compromised by the actions of a few." In a statement, Mayor Bill de Blasio said, "The NYPD is committed to the safety of New Yorkers and we will not allow it to be used as a tool for harassment or intimidation. "We will not allow it to be used to undermine the work of police officers and our communities. We will not allow it to be used to intimidate our community and we will not allow it to be used to profit from the oppression of our community." The NYPD and Mayor Bill de Blasio have not said what they will do next. The protests began last weekend, when the city council voted to ban chokeholds in the city. Mayor Bill de Blasio told CNN that the NYPD is still reviewing the council's vote. The ban was later overturned by the city's Board of Police Commissioners. "I don't want to get into the weeds of what will happen in the future," de Blasio said. "We want to make sure that the police department is as effective as it can be and that we have a culture change in the police department."
 After a grand jury in Baltimore failed to indict a white police officer in the death of Freddie Gray, the nation's attention turned to the case of an African-American police officer, Darren Toms, who was killed in a high-speed police chase. But for the first time since Gray's death, the nation saw two videos from the same vantage point. The first video showed the aftermath of Gray's arrest and the second video, which was recorded by his wife, showed the aftermath of the arrest. The video captured the moment when a police officer pulled Gray over for allegedly failing to use his turn signal. He was then run over by a police officer. Gray died on April 12, the day after he was arrested. Here are some other developments in the case of the two police officers involved in Gray's death. Protests over the deaths of Gray and other African-Americans have spurred protests across the nation, with more than 200 demonstrations in more than 30 cities.

 A White filmmaker held up a Black Lives Matter sign in Harrison, Arkansas, and here's what happened next. 'It's not about the flag' The controversial statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee was vandalized with graffiti, and a Black Lives Matter protester was arrested. A local resident called the police to report the vandalism. Police said they found a photo of the statue online and arrested the person who posted the photo. "The vandalism was done in the name of a political movement, not a hate crime," Harrison Police Chief Todd W. Anderson said. "It's not about the flag. It's about the people who were targeted because of the color of their skin. This is about the people who were targeted because of the actions of a few." The vandalism came after a rally for Black Lives Matter. Demonstrators waved a banner and chanted "No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA" outside the statue's location. The event was peaceful. CNN affiliate WMC said the demonstrators were there to protest "racist and anti-Semitic policies" in the country.
 He had no fear of the man who had shot him in the chest, and he had no fear of the police officer who had shot him in the leg. The man was a complete stranger to the young man in the photo.

I was scared for my family and my kids." The young man is 15-year-old Dakin Armstrong, who was shot by an officer in the head after he ran away from police in the early morning hours of April 17. Armstrong's death was ruled a homicide by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office, but the grand jury didn't indict the officer. He was not armed when he was shot. "I don't have a weapon of any kind, but I have a gun," Armstrong said. "I have a permit to carry it." Armstrong said he was in a school bathroom at the time of the shooting. "I didn't have any idea that it was going to happen like it did. I was just thinking about my kids. I was worried about them, and I'm just glad that it's over." Armstrong's family has said they want answers. "I'm hoping that this can be a wake-up call to those around us who are scared and afraid of our police force and the government," his mother, Lucien Armstrong, said. "I'm hoping that the people who have guns can feel safe and protected and then we can start moving on with our lives."

 An 'admitted leader of the KKK' is sentenced to 6 years in prison for driving his truck through Black Lives Matter protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia.

The former police officer who killed Heather Heyer, a 32-year-old paralegal who was marching peacefully in Charlottesville, has been sentenced to life in prison.

George Floyd, a 45-year-old black man, was sentenced to life in prison on Friday for first-degree murder and five counts of malicious wounding, the maximum sentence for both crimes. Floyd's sentence was the first of the five men charged in the attack on Saturday night. Floyd, who was unarmed, was killed when a car plowed into a group of people protesting against the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville. Floyd was carrying a permit to protest the planned rally, which was organized by the far-right "Unite the Right" group. Police said they saw a car speeding away from the group. The attack started when Floyd was hit with a car door, and then the gunfire erupted. Five men were charged in his death. The five men face charges including first-degree murder, malicious wounding and felonious assault. The attack on Floyd began when a car drove into a group of demonstrators, killing Heather Heyer, 32, and injuring 19 others.
 The mayor of Charlottesville has issued a statement saying the city will not condemn the white nationalists and "white supremacists" who have descended on the city. "I condemn this act of violence in the strongest possible terms," Mayor Mike Signer said. "We will not stand by and watch our city or our citizens suffer. The violence of the last night has only served to highlight the fact that the city of Charlottesville, and our nation, still has much more to offer than a political football match." Signer said the city will not stand by and watch its citizens suffer "because of this man's actions." "I am reminded that our city's history is full of examples of peaceful protest and reflection. But this attack, in which the masked shooter stood proudly in the street, brandishing weapons of violence, only to be confronted with bullets in the street and the life of a young man, is an attack on all of us," Signer said.
 In an emotional press conference Monday, FBI Director James Comey and the acting director of the bureau's Richmond field office, Michael Steinbach, said they did not find any evidence to support the claim that the men responsible for Saturday's violence were inspired by the groups that descended on the city last weekend. But they did say that they were troubled by the evidence collected from witnesses and investigators. "It's not enough to say that we don't have a motive," Comey said. "We have not found one. We have not found one that satisfies our description." "And it certainly doesn't mean that we don't have one. We don't have one," he added. The FBI has already interviewed witnesses and collected evidence. The US attorney's office in the Eastern District of Virginia is investigating the attack. "We have found that there was no nexus between the actions of the white nationalists and those opposed to them on

 After a White man repeatedly erased girl's 'Black Lives Matter' chalk drawing in front of her home, neighbors stepped in to show support for her. She said it's 'very, very sad' that a white police officer is 'the one that should be facing charges.' "She said she hopes the police officers involved in her case are found and fired, and that her family will not have to endure the same ordeal. "I feel like I'm constantly in the news, and I don't really get the significance of it," she said. "I'm just trying to get by."
 It was a lonely afternoon, but the video of a white police officer shot by a black suspect at a high-profile protest in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, grabbed the world's attention. It shows a white officer facing an armed black suspect as the two struggle over a Taser. The video, which has been viewed more than 500,000 times on Facebook, has sparked outrage and debate. Some people believe the video shows that the officer was justified in shooting the black man. Others say it shows that the officer was trying to justify his actions. There are three different versions of the video, which are being debated on social media. One says that the officer shot the man in self-defense. The other says the officer was justified in shooting the man. The third says that the officer was justified in shooting the man. The debate started after the officer was shot by a Black Lives Matter demonstrator. CNN's Don Lemon said the video "makes it look like the officer was justified in shooting the man in the video, when in fact he was not." "It's the officer's actions that matter," he said. "It's the actions of the bystanders that matter, as well. The bystander who filmed the whole thing and shared it with his friends and family is not the officer in the video." Some people say the video shows the officer's actions were justified. "It's the totality of his actions that make it look like he did what he needed to do in order to protect himself and others," said Charles Kinsey, a criminology professor at the University of South Carolina. "It's the totality of his actions that make it look like he was justified in the actions he took, but it's the totality of his actions that make it look like he was a racist." Kinsey said the officer in the video "had a clear reason to shoot him" and that the police chief should be held accountable. "There is no doubt in my mind that the officer was justified in his actions," Kinsey said. "The totality of his actions was justified." Kinsey said that the police chief should be fired and charged. "You can't fire an officer," Kinsey said. "He has the power to take a life. He has the power to take a life

 "They were very disrespectful toward him, and I don't know what happened afterwards," he said. "They were very disrespectful toward me and my family and they threw the bottle at my mom. They were very disrespectful toward the police officers." On Monday night, the US Attorney's Office in the Southern District of New York announced that it was filing a complaint against the officers involved in the arrest. The officers were not accused of violating the civil rights of the young man. "The conduct depicted by the defendants is repugnant to the core values of the United States of America," said Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who announced the charges Tuesday. "The defendants have demonstrated a pattern of behavior that is repugnant to the law and of a nature and degree that is repugnant to the dignity of the young men who they are sworn to serve and protect." The officers were not accused of a crime. In a statement, a lawyer for the officers said that the officers acted within the law and had acted in self-defense. "They have been cleared of any wrongdoing," said attorney Tom Rosenberger. "They are grateful for the opportunity to prove their innocence before the court." The officers were released on personal recognizance with pay and no jail time was served.

 A ride-share driver fatally shot a man at the Austin Black Lives Matter rally 'to protect his own life,' lawyer says' "The next day, the driver was charged with capital murder. He was arraigned on that charge last week. The judge set bond at $500,000. At that hearing, defense attorney Andy Savage said the man was driving a vehicle with a loaded gun in the back and was trying to protect himself. "The defendant never intended to harm Mr. Kelley," Savage said. "The defendant had no intention of killing Mr. Kelley." Police said the man was carrying a loaded .38-caliber handgun. Savage said the man's attorney didn't dispute the facts in the shooting. "The defendant had no regard for the man's safety and even though he was aware of the dangers of driving a car with a loaded gun in the car, the defendant's reckless disregard for Mr. Kelley's safety was the reason why the car went off," he said. 'A little over a month ago' Police said the man's car was found a few miles from the rally site. The investigation into the shooting is ongoing. 'He just wanted to protect his own life' The rally was meant to draw attention to the recent killings of unarmed black men by police officers, and to raise awareness about police brutality. "We're asking people to protest peacefully and peacefully engage in peaceful assembly," said Matt Gonzalez, organizer of the rally. "But if you're going to protest peacefully, you need to be prepared to defend yourself, and we're going to work with the police to make sure that you do not take the lives of others." Police said the man who was shot was wearing a mask, a vest and a ballistic vest. He was taken to a hospital with life-threatening injuries. The man was also shot by bystanders, according to the police department. A witness said the man was pointing a gun at the police, police said. Gonzalez said he did not witness the shooting. He said he was in the crowd and saw the man's arm go through the windshield and fall into the street. "He just wanted to protect his own life," Gonzalez said. Gonzalez said the man who was shot was a member of the Proud Boys, a right-wing youth organization. "They're more militarized and more intimidating now that they were before the rally," Gonzalez said. Gonzalez said the group was protesting police brutality and racism. "They're trying to get rid of the police," he said. "They're going to kill them."
 A Chicago police officer was charged with first-degree murder Wednesday in the death of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald. The officer, Michael Brelo, was fired after being indicted on Tuesday by a federal grand jury. "We want to make sure that this officer's actions do not reflect on the badge of the police department," Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy said. "We want to make sure that he is held accountable for his actions." Chicago police fired Brelo, 37, in February after he shot McDonald, a black teenager, in a schoolyard fight over a toy. The shooting sparked a wave of violence that killed 12 people, including three police officers. A source close to the investigation said that the police officer who shot McDonald was not the only officer involved in the incident. Investigators are looking into whether McDonald was the victim of a "suicide by cop" or if he was the target of a "suicide by cop." The officer was not the target of the gunfire, but prosecutors have said the fatal shot was justified. The officer's attorney has said he was not armed when he shot McDonald. "The officer fired eight shots, and the fatal shots were not from the officer's weapon," McCarthy said. "They were from a bystander's perspective. The officer was not in immediate danger." "This is a time of mourning," McCarthy said. "We ask that our community mourns in peace." The officer, who has not been charged, is white, and the bystander, who was not identified, is black. The shooting happened on Thursday night after a man allegedly pointed a gun at police officers, authorities said. Police said the man, later identified as 19-

 NBA season restarts with a nod to Black Lives Matter and 2 games that went down to the wire. The Cavaliers will be in Houston tonight to take on the Rockets, who beat the Cavs in a first-round playoff game. In the series finale, the Rockets won in a game that was close until the last seconds, when LeBron James sent the game into overtime. It was the first time in NBA history that two teams had tied games in the first overtime period. The series, which has been a must-watch for sports fans, has been the stuff of legends for years. And it won't be the last.
 The news, which was first reported by CNN's Don Lemon, was first reported by The Wall Street Journal's Susan Slusser. The team said the three players will be released from their contracts. The league has not yet responded to CNN's request for comment. "The league and the NBPA have reached an agreement that will provide a path forward for all players, officials and staff to achieve the financial and health benefits of being in the NBA," NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. "We look forward to working with all parties on this important and mutually beneficial agreement." The players, who have not been paid by the league since mid-June, have been represented by NBPA and the Players Association for months. The league and NBPA reached a deal in the next few days. The deal will be made public on Friday. The NBA has been under fire in recent days over the treatment of players and teams. On Wednesday, the league and the NBPA announced a new policy that bans players and teams from using social media platforms to comment on player matters. "This new policy is an important step in the right direction in that it will help protect the integrity of our game and the public's perception of it," said NBPA President John Bosley. "We look forward to working with the NBA and all other stakeholders to make sure this important change is a success." The policy bans players from using social media platforms, including Twitter, to comment on the league or to petition the league for change. "We are committed to protecting the rights of our players and our fans and applaud Commissioner Adam Silver for taking this important step to keep the game of basketball free from harmful influence," NBPA Executive Director Roger Mason said in a statement. "We look forward to working with him and Commissioner Adam Silver in an effort to make the game more accessible and accessible to all fans." "The NBPA and NBA have made it clear that the NBPA and its members are not going anywhere," NBPA Executive Director Terrell Stansbury said in a statement.

 The results were clear: Black voters approved the first major change to the city charter since the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. The election of the first black mayor in the city's history was a major victory for the Black Lives Matter movement, which has long pushed for the formation of a police department of more diverse racial lines and a more activist bent. And it came as a week of protests and unrest in the city of Ferguson brought national attention to the problems of police brutality and racial discrimination faced by black communities. But what happened next was anything but celebratory. The police department was stripped of most of its powers, including the power to arrest protesters. The city also elected a new police chief and appointed a prosecutor to lead its criminal division. The changes were the first of a new direction for Ferguson's police department in years. The changes came after months of debate in the city's city council over what the changes would do. Among those who voted against the changes were the mayor, the police chief and the city's police chief. But the city council voted unanimously to approve the changes in a 13-9 vote. The mayor called the new direction "a long overdue change in direction" and said they would be "implemented with the utmost vigor." The changes were expected to take months to implement. The city council approved the changes at a meeting that was livestreamed on the city's website. Some protesters were among the members who spoke out against the changes. In the weeks since the election of a black mayor in Ferguson, protests have spread to the nation's capital, Washington, and to other cities with larger populations.

The video shows the intersection of University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center's Dr. Michael Carroll Parkway and I-35W. It shows the vehicle traveling at about 20 miles per hour and stops briefly at the intersection of two lanes of traffic before speeding north on Dr. Carroll Parkway. A witness to the shooting told CNN affiliate KTRK that she saw a white male, later identified as the driver, standing in the middle of the road and a young black man running across the road toward the driver. The witness said the young black man was shouting profanities. "He was throwing rocks at the car. I was not expecting that because I was expecting to see a white male," she said. The witness said the young black man was yelling racial slurs and was yelling at the car as it sped away. "He was screaming that he was going to kill the car," she said. "He was yelling that he was going to kill the car and I was not expecting that."

 How Black Lives Matter went from a hashtag to a global rallying cry in the wake of the deaths of unarmed African-American men by police. Many protesters have called for the Black Lives Matter movement to take on a broader political agenda, and some have even gone as far as to call for the assassination of police officers. But the movement has largely avoided overt political statements. At the same time, the movement has made a few controversial statements. One of the most prominent was when it called for the "immediate and unconditional release" of Dylann Roof, a white man who shot and killed nine black church members in Charleston, South Carolina. The group has also called for the release of videos showing police misconduct. While the group has said it will not use violence, the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, is a prime example. That case, which spurred the Black Lives Matter movement, became a catalyst for protests around the world. In the weeks after Brown's death, demonstrators have marched, staged sit-ins and even rioted in some cities. What do you think? Do you agree that the Black Lives Matter movement has run out of ideas?
 The death of 25-year-old Michael Brown, who was unarmed, has reignited Black Lives Matter protests. Protesters have been calling for justice in his death since the officer, Darren Wilson, shot him dead in August 2014. CNN has been unable to reach Brown's family for comment. The city of Ferguson has not responded to CNN's request for comment. The protests have taken a violent turn since the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown by a white police officer in August 2014. Black Lives Matter activists say the attacks have led to a rise in police brutality and racial violence. "We're seeing a rise in the number of police brutality cases, particularly against African-Americans," said Darryl Alexander, a professor of criminal justice at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. "The violence against African-Americans is not new. The violence against people of color is. The violence against African-Americans is now being directed at African-Americans in a much more vicious and brutal way." It's a stark contrast from the early years of the movement, when the Black Lives Matter movement focused on issues of police brutality and racial injustice. "The movement was more of a protest movement than anything else," Alexander said. "It was a lot of push-pull in terms of what activists were doing and what politicians were doing. The idea of what we want to see happen in the world is much more important to people than what we see in real life." 'We don't need any more police brutality' CNN is having trouble finding people willing to talk about the protests. People are "switching from one thing to another," said Alex Heinemeier, a CNN political commentator. "We don't need any more police brutality. We don't need any more police militarization. We just need to get back to the way things used to be." Heinemeier said the movement is "going to be the most difficult thing about going forward for a lot of people." "There will be a lot of anger," he said. "A lot of frustration. A lot of frustration." But, he said, "I think that the anger will be directed at the government, at the police and at some of the other issues that have caused it. The anger will be directed at the things that have led to this point." A CNN/ORC poll from July found that nearly three-quarters of Americans say police use excessive force against people of color, including at least 40% who say they have used a chokehold. But even among those who say they have used a chokehold, 58% say the tactic is rarely used by police, and 34% say it is sometimes used by police. The poll also found that more than half of those who have used a chokehold say they have used it only once, and only a quarter of those who say they have used it in the past have used it in the past. The poll results show that anger is not a factor in the protests. "What we're seeing is that the protests are becoming a part of everyday life for a lot of Americans. They're not just a 'Black Lives Matter' thing," said Alexander. "They're also a part of the broader American experience." 'We're all feeling the pain' The protests have been fueled by a number of different sources, but one that has been especially potent is the video of Michael Brown's death. The footage captured the horrific aftermath of the fatal shooting by a white police officer, Darren Wilson, while he was driving his police car. The fatal shooting of Brown, an unarmed black man, sparked outrage and protests across the country. People across the country took to the streets in a show of solidarity with Brown's family and call for justice. "What's really powerful about the video is that it shows not just what happened but also what people are feeling. It shows us all that there are people all

 The investigation into the shooting death of George Floyd continued Monday with the filing of a charge of voluntary manslaughter. Floyd's family: We want justice, not change The justice system must not be used to "perpetuate social control and racial subordination," said Mark Levin, a co-founder of the American Conservative, in a statement. "We want a fair, just, and lasting investigation into this case. We want our community to be safe and free from fear and violence. We want to see a swift, fair, and just resolution of the case. We want our community to have confidence in the justice system. We want to see a race-based prosecution of the case," he said. "We want to see a thorough and transparent investigation of the case. We want to see an end to police brutality and all forms of injustice." Floyd died on July 5, 2017, after a Minneapolis police officer shot him in the back as he lay dying. The video of the incident, captured by a bystander, sparked outrage and protests around the country. The police department has said Floyd was armed, but there are no videos or photos of Floyd's death or of the aftermath of the shooting. Floyd's family: We want change, not change, the family's attorney said in a statement. "We want to see the changes that we can make in our community, but the justice system has failed us. The system has failed our family and our community," he said. "We want to see real change, not an immediate, symbolic change. We want to see real change, not a perceived change, and we want to see real change, not a made-up change, that will result in more incidents of police brutality, more deaths of unarmed black men, and a larger percentage of black males behind bars."
 The shooting of Floyd, who was unarmed, sparked outrage and protests around the country. Floyd's death spurred the Black Lives Matter movement, which has since spread to include other civil rights groups, including the Black Lives Matter National Association. Activists have been demanding justice for Floyd since his death. Activists have been calling for Floyd's arrest and the prosecution of the officers involved in his death.

 This week, the Supreme Court heard arguments in a case that could shape the future of race and policing. The high court will decide whether police officers' use of deadly force is unconstitutional. The case centers on whether a police officer can use deadly force against a suspect who is fleeing police. The outcome of the case could have implications for how police conduct themselves on the streets. The 5-4 decision could lead to changes in the way police conduct themselves and how they interact with citizens. But the reaction from some in the black community has been muted. "It's a very complicated case, and it's going to take time to understand all the facts of the case," said Shauna A. Wilson, a civil rights attorney and CNN political commentator.

 Black Lives Matter protests across America continue nearly 2 months after George Floyd's death. The NYPD has said it will not release the names of the officers involved in the incident. CNN has reached out to the NYPD for a comment. The demonstrations have been largely peaceful so far. But there have been reports of clashes between police and protesters, as well as a number of deaths.
 The shooting death of Floyd, a Black man, sparked protests across the country. But a grand jury in Miami-Dade County declined to indict the officers involved. The decision came after prosecutors failed to find probable cause to charge them with first-degree murder. The city of Miami-Dade County also declined to hold an investigation into the death. "The fact that there was no grand jury means that the officers were not indicted," Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in a statement Tuesday. "But they were held accountable anyway. This is a key part of the justice system that has been abused for far too long and must be reformed." Floyd was shot on August 9, 2016, after police responded to a call about a man, who they said was armed, who was hiding in a backyard. The officers saw Floyd, who was running, and shot him multiple times, according to the attorney. "He was just standing there, still in his shirt, still in his pants," the attorney said. "They shot him because he was a threat." The officers were cleared of any wrongdoing, but a grand jury in Miami-Dade County declined to indict them. "The failure to indict these officers is a stark reminder of how much work still remains to make sure that our criminal justice system serves all of our citizens fairly and effectively," Lynch said. "This failure to indict them is not the answer. It is a responsibility that we all must take on." Protests continue Across the country, protests continued for the second night in the aftermath of Floyd's death. Demonstrators carried signs and carried a few messages. The grand jury in Miami-Dade declined to indict the officers.
 "The grand jury was not unanimous in its decision, but it did reach the conclusion that the officers' actions were objectively reasonable under the circumstances presented to the grand jury," said Mark Jamar, the prosecutor in the case. "The officers' actions were consistent with their training and the criminal code of the state of Florida," he said. "The officers' actions were also consistent with the standards of care and professionalism expected of them by the law enforcement community. The actions of the grand jury were supported by the evidence presented at the trial." In a statement, the attorney general said the decision "is a strong rebuke of the actions of the grand jury, which failed to reach its verdict in the killing of George Floyd." Floyd was shot by two Miami police officers on July 5, 2016, in the back as he lay dying in a police chokehold. One of the officers, Raphael Leal, was fired after he was charged with second-degree murder. The other officer, Dustin Schwarze, was acquitted. Schwarze was also charged with obstruction of justice. The officers were acquitted in a disciplinary trial earlier this year. The attorneys for the officers said the actions of the grand jury were unreasonable. "The grand jury was empaneled to evaluate the evidence and to reach a determination in the matter of whether the officers acted within the law," the attorneys said in a statement. "The officers' actions were objectively reasonable under the circumstances presented to the grand jury. The officers' actions were consistent with the standards of care and professionalism expected of them by the law enforcement community." "It is unfortunate that the grand jury failed to reach a verdict, but the fact that no verdict was reached in this trial does not mean that the officers were not guilty of any wrongdoing," the attorneys said. The officers were acquitted of any wrongdoing in a second-degree murder trial. The grand jury was empaneled to evaluate evidence and to reach a determination in the matter of whether the officers acted within the law. The officers' actions were objectively reasonable under the circumstances presented to the grand jury, said the attorneys. The officers' actions were consistent with the standards of care and professionalism expected of them by the law enforcement community. "No one can take away the fact that George Floyd was a black man, but the fact that no verdict was reached in this trial does not mean that the officers were not guilty of any wrongdoing," said attorney Mark O'Mara. "And it is equally important to point out that the grand jury was empaneled to evaluate evidence and to reach a determination in the matter of whether the officers acted within the law. "The fact that no verdict was reached in this trial does not mean that the officers were not guilty of any wrongdoing," O'Mara said. The officers' actions were unreasonable, but not illegal, police said. "Officer Schwarze acted in a lawful manner to restrain Floyd. Officer Leal followed protocol and followed his training to render aid. The actions of the officers were reasonable under the circumstances presented

The mural, which depicts a woman holding a gun, was spray-painted in the middle of the street where protesters gathered on Wednesday, the day after Trump's inauguration. The mural has been spray-painted with the words, "Trump is Not Welcome" and "No Trump, No KKK, No fascist USA." It was spray-painted on the building's facade and on the side of the building where protesters were housed. The graffiti reads, "You are not welcome in our city." NYPD officials said the vandalism is being investigated as a hate crime.

 Black Lives Matter's surprising target: Los Angeles County's first Black district attorney. "They don't like that there's an independent prosecutor there that's looking into the conduct of the county," says Bekenstein, the University of South Carolina law professor. "They're saying that there should be a prosecutor there. That's not a good thing. And they're not going to take it without saying that." The most surprising and disturbing takeaway from the Washington Post's reporting on the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office is that the DA is not as aggressive as one might expect. In fact, the office is so dysfunctional it doesn't even have a budget. "They don't have the resources to do their job, which is to hold the police accountable," says Michael Oppenheimer, a former director of the office who now runs the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. "The DA is one of the most resistant to change in law enforcement." It's no surprise that the DA has not fared well in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd. Oppenheimer says it's not that the office is corrupt or inept. "They're not," he says. "They're run by a bunch of people who have been in power for a long time. It's hard to see how they can fix themselves and get out of the way of the current system." The reason the office hasn't been able to address the systemic racism that has led to the current situation is simple: It's a function of the people who run it, he says. "The people who run the DA don't have a clue about the racism that is happening in their own office," Oppenheimer says. "There is a racist component to it. It's not a rogue component. It's part of the system. It's part of the system. But the people who run the DA don't want to hear about it. They don't want to face it. They don't want to talk about it." A DA who doesn't want to face it is a DA who is missing the point, says Bekenstein of the University of South Carolina. "The point of an independent prosecutor is to hold the police accountable," he says. "They're not going to fix themselves. The DA is not going to fix itself. The people who are running it are going to continue to get paid."

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) Black Lives Matter protesters, who have been marching in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, were met with a "yes, we can" response from the NYPD, which has used a variety of tactics in recent days to stave off violence, from deploying tactical teams to keep the peace, to announcing it will no longer use the death penalty. At the same time, the NYPD has declined to use its discretion in deciding which protests to prosecute, a senior NYPD official told CNN. "As a result, the NYPD will not be able to cite or arrest demonstrators or their supporters at these protests," the official said. "We will instead make arrests based on the direction of the NYPD Police Commissioner, who will take over from the President." In New York City, where protests are being held for the second night in support of the movement, the NYPD's decision to not prosecute a protester caught on video kicking a police officer in the face was met with outrage from protesters. "What kind of justice is that?" one demonstrator asked. "I don't see any kind of justice." Protesters also criticized the NYPD for using tactical nukes to disperse the crowds.

CNN's Don Lemon, who tweeted about the NBA's reaction, noted that the league's slow response to the situation has been a big reason the NBA is in the news. "The NBA has been slow to respond to the racial divide that's been bubbling in the wake of the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others, and while they may not be the first to use their platform to voice their concerns, it's clear that the league's response has been underwhelming," Lemon said. "NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has been clear that he wants to see more diversity in the league, and to that end, he's been a vocal opponent of the Black Lives Matter movement, as well as President Donald Trump." The NBA has been a leader in social justice and civil rights for decades The NBA has been a leader in social justice and civil rights for decades, making the world a better place through its commitment to social justice. In 2017, the NBA and the National Basketball Association released the "Black Lives Matter" national platform, a groundbreaking initiative that saw the league championing of the Black Lives Matter movement and advocating for social justice and racial equality. The NBA's decision to remove itself from the platform and hold an all-day Black Lives Matter protest was a bold move, as the league had been a leader in the movement and was one of the first major sports leagues to publicly say that police officers who kill Black people need to be held accountable. In the words of the NBA's then-chairman and current president, David Stern, the league's decision to remove itself from the platform was a "tactical mistake." "The NBA is a family and we want our players and employees to be able to be themselves, to have their own lives and to have their own opinions," Stern said. "We want the NBA to be a welcoming and inclusive place for all fans, players and employees. It's not about one group of people or another.

 Two people were hurt by a car as a Black Lives Matter demonstration was ending in Indiana. Police said the injuries ranged from a broken jaw to a bruised lung. On Saturday, protesters gathered in Dallas, Texas, and in New York City. In Washington, the protests were largely peaceful, but at least 1,000 people were arrested in the District. The demonstrations came in response to the killing of George Floyd, who was shot by police while protesting a death in custody. Floyd's death, which was captured on video, sparked protests across the US and around the world. Floyd's death was ruled a homicide, but Floyd's family sued the city of Dallas, which ultimately settled with Floyd's family for $5 million. CNN's Chris Cillizza reported that the protesters in Washington "believed that the city could have handled this protest in a more responsible and thoughtful manner, by not deploying the National Guard and instead by allowing peaceful demonstrations to continue." Demonstrations continued throughout the day. In New York City, thousands marched peacefully, carrying signs and pictures of Floyd. The protesters were mostly peaceful, though at times some hurled rocks and bottles at police. Police in New York City said there were no major incidents reported in New York, but that some protesters threw fireworks and bricks at officers.

 Police are looking for two White people who painted over a Black Lives Matter mural on a building in the city's Southside. The mural depicts a Black man being shot and killed by police. The two White people who painted the mural, who have not been identified, are also in the police custody. The two Black people who were inside the building at the time of the shooting were not injured. The mayor of Chicago has said that the White people who were involved in the shooting "should be charged with their actions." "They have been charged with the murder of a Black man," Mayor Rahm Emanuel said. "The police officers involved in this case are held to a higher standard. We expect them to be held accountable."
 They were one of the first groups of Black people to protest in Chicago after the shooting death of 17-year-old Michael Brown. "The Black Lives Matter movement is not a movement to protest," said Tanishia Crenshaw, a political activist and director of the Chicago chapter of the National Action Network. "It is a movement to reclaim our city and reclaim our history." The protests have seen demonstrators from all walks of life come together, from the LGBTQ community to the traditional political left. "It's become a true community movement," said Crenshaw, who lives in Chicago and works in New York. "It's become a platform for Black people to speak out and demand justice." 'They don't want the police to be able to harm us' Chicago is a city of many things. It's a city of jobs, of commerce, of culture, of energy. But also of hate and violence and despair. Some say it's also become the playground for gangs and gangs of other criminals. "They don't want the police to be able to harm us," said Wesley Lowery, a 19-year-old activist who lives in Chicago and was one of the first Black people to protest in the city. "They don't want the police to be able to do what they do to us anymore. They don't want our kids to be coming out of high school and thinking about it when they get out of school, 'Oh, I'm going to be a police officer, that's going to get me killed. I'm not going to do that anymore. I'm going to protest and fight for something else.'"
 The video, posted to Twitter, showed a man being thrown to the ground by police as he lay on the ground. A second man is seen lying on the ground, unconscious. CNN has not confirmed the identity of the third man shown in the video. The officer was not identified

 Indiana priest suspended after calling Black Lives Matter and antifa protesters 'maggots,' 'parasites' and 'serpents in the garden' The Rev.

"It's disgraceful that they were not charged with any crimes. It's disgraceful that they were not charged with any crimes." The mayor of Charlottesville said the city has not seen any evidence that the three men conspired to incite violence. But the mayor said the city will investigate the men's actions. 'I'm not the kind of person who would do that' The three men were arrested Wednesday night, Charlottesville police said. "I'm not the kind of person who would do that," Charlottesville Police Chief Al Aiken told CNN's Don Lemon. "I'm the kind of person that would never do that." The chief said he didn't know whether the men had guns. "I would assume that they did not have any weapons at the time of the incident," Aiken said. "We have to determine whether a weapon was found on them. I'm not the kind of person who would do that." The men were released from jail Thursday night. The city's attorney general said the city will charge the men with third-degree assault, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. The three men have been charged with two counts of malicious wounding. CNN's Sara Sidner contributed to this report.
 The man who opened fire on the crowd during the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville was shot and killed by a police officer who was angry about the "white power" rally, the city said.

 A Muslim woman says her headscarf was forcibly removed from her head for a booking photo after being arrested at a Black Lives Matter protest. The headscarf was later returned. The protest, which was organized by the Council on American-Islamic Relations, turned violent. In one incident, a man punched a protester in the face, police said. But a group of Black Lives Matter protesters took to the streets to protest the beating. They were met by police in riot gear and tear gas. One person was arrested. Black Lives Matter protesters were joined by people of all ages, including some children, who demonstrated in the streets. It was one of the first protests I have seen with my own eyes. The protesters were mostly peaceful, but there were some tense exchanges with police. Some people were arrested.
 It was a quiet night, but it was still pretty cool. And there were some cool shots of it. The first day of protests was one of the coolest nights I've ever been to a protest. You know, like, the one where they had a helicopter hovering above the whole place and it was kinda cool. The other cool thing about the day was that the NYPD actually put out a statement saying that they will no longer be arresting people who block traffic on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. It was a huge deal. But mostly it was cool. The city was like a movie set. The streets were lit up with colors and sounds and glitter and sparkles and teddy bears and flamingos and balloons and a whole bunch of other stuff. There was even a little kid in a pink and white tank top who had some cool looking baseball capes on. It was pretty cool. Like, for real. So when I heard that the NYPD would no longer be arresting people who block traffic on Fifth Avenue, I thought, wow, cool, I'll bet my bottom dollar that that that's exactly what's going to happen. That's what happens when you've got the resources and the manpower. And I mean, if they actually do it, that means the NYPD is going to be able to arrest more people. They're going to be able to put more cops on the street. I mean, I'm not saying that's going to happen, but if they do it, it will definitely change the way the NYPD operates. They're going to have to figure out how to run a criminal justice system that works. They're going to have to figure out how to keep people safe. They're going to have to figure out how to deal with the mentally ill. There's going to be a lot of data that points to a change in that regard. And the NYPD is going to have to figure out how to get better at that. And I think there's going to be a lot of frustration. Because what they're going to do is they're going to have to really, really, really try to change. And they're going to have to really, really, really try to do it.

"I'm disappointed that the city council voted to ban the Confederate flag, but I'm equally frustrated that they voted to remove the flag from City Hall," Mayor Greg Fischer said. "It is a symbol of hate and racism that we must never, ever allow to be displayed on our city." Fischer said the city will put the flag back up. "This flag ban will be enforced, and the flag will be put back up in City Hall," he said. "This flag ban is a victory for our city, our community and our flag.

 Black Lives Matter protests have not led to a spike in coronavirus cases, research says. Instead, the two trends have been linked to other factors. The first is that people are still getting tested. People may not be testing positive for coronavirus, but they are testing positive for other infectious diseases. And the first thing that people do when they test positive for coronavirus is to get tested for other infectious diseases, like tuberculosis.

 It was the first time since the shooting death of Michael Brown that the grand jury heard the case against the officers involved in his death. The two sides in the case, which was heard by a grand jury last week, will face off in court Thursday. The shooting of a unarmed black man by a white police officer sparked nationwide protests and debate over the use of force between police and minorities. Brown, a black man, was shot by an officer after allegedly trying to take his gun. His death led to a major police reform movement.
 The officers' attorneys argued that the city's use of deadly force policy requires them to shoot first. The grand jury will decide whether to indict the officers in the death of 18-year-old Tyrone "T.Y." Holloway. The officers are white, but their trial is being held separately from the prosecution. The grand jury is expected to hear testimony from as many as seven officers. But the identities of the other officers remain a mystery. The grand jury will also hear testimony from the officers' spouses, and possibly from other family members. "This is a case that is going to be riveted on in the city of Ferguson," Ferguson Police Chief James Knowles III told reporters. "It's going to be in the national spotlight. People are going to be talking about it. People are going to be watching." The Ferguson grand jury will hear testimony from the family members of one of the officers, as well as from an expert witness. "This is going to be a very, very tough case," Knowles said. "We're going to have to prove that this officer did not do what he was charged with doing." The officers' attorneys argued that the city's use of deadly force policy requires them to shoot first.

"We will not have access to the police reports or dashcam video of the incident until the trial is over." The case against the officers is expected to last several weeks.

 Boy Scouts of America shows support for Black Lives Matter and will require some scouts to earn diversity badge. But it has been a long time since the organization has shown such a commitment to diversity and inclusion. In the past, the organization has taken a hard stance against such organizations as the KKK and Nazis, which it once called its "favorite enemy." In a recent statement, the organization said it was "shocked" by the violence in Charlottesville and said it will "continue to work closely with local, state and federal authorities in their investigation of the events." "We stand by our core values and will not tolerate the kind of hate speech and violence that took place in Charlottesville," the statement said.
 In the early 1970s, the first of its kind, the Boy Scouts of America began allowing openly gay youth to join. The organization still uses a policy barring openly gay youth from leadership positions. It's not clear how many gay youth joined the organization in the 1970s. But the impact of the policy is clear today. In the early 1980s, the organization's Board of Directors voted to ban the ordination of gay youth. Today, the Boy Scouts of America is the only organization that bans openly gay youth from its ranks. The decision to ban gay youth from the organization has been met with protests, boycotts and even death threats. It's hard to imagine a more inclusive organization than the Boy Scouts of America, which has said it will ban gay youth from leadership positions. But the organization has not done that yet. The ban is expected to come into effect in 2019. Boy Scouts of America officials have said they plan to continue to ban gay youth. But there's growing support from groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and the Human Rights Campaign that want the organization to ban gay adults. The ACLU of Southern California released a statement this week saying it will file a lawsuit against the Boy Scouts of America later this year. The Human Rights Campaign says it will file a similar suit against the Boy Scouts of America later this year. Boy Scouts of America officials say they are considering other policies to protect against bullying and abuse. The organization also says it will ban the use of cookies

 Black Lives Matter activist found dead one week after she went missing in Florida. A new wave of racist violence in the US has been blamed on white supremacist groups and extremist groups like the Proud Boys. But what exactly is the "alt-right" and how did it get started?
 There's a lot of talk about the alt-right these days, and that's because there's a lot of hate speech and violence being spewed out of it. "The alt-right is a loose confederation of white nationalists, neo-Nazis, and all-around racists, whose stated goals include the destruction of the mainstream conservative movement, the establishment of a white ethno-state, and the re-imaging of history to make their point," CNN's Don Lemon wrote this week. "Their anti-immigration stance is sometimes described as 'America First.' They're also sometimes referred to as 'alt-right' or 'white nationalists.' Their hate speech and white nationalist propaganda have been credited with inspiring some of the most violent white supremacist groups in history." The term has become a rallying cry for some Americans who see it as a counter-culture alternative to mainstream conservatism. The "alt-right" is the term used to describe those who identify with the ideas of the alt-right, but who also believe in free speech, white nationalism and the preservation of traditional American culture. It's often associated with violent extremist groups like the Proud Boys, whose leader, Joseph Lloyd, told CNN's Don Lemon that the term has become a "dissident symbol." "The alt-right is a loose confederation of white nationalists, neo-Nazis, and all-around racists, whose stated goals include the destruction of the mainstream conservative movement, the establishment of a white ethno-state, and the re-imaging of history to make their point." While the term has become associated with violent extremists, it's also used by people who are simply apolitical. That's why it has become so controversial. "It's a term that I think has a lot of baggage," University of Maryland's Joseph P. O'Donnell told CNN's Don Lemon

 He proposed to his girlfriend at a Black Lives Matter protest to celebrate black love. She was shocked, he said. "She started crying. I didn't think she would be that open about it," he said. He said the cops didn't tell him what happened next. He was on the ground handcuffed and he felt "violated," he said. He said he was unable to move his legs, so he was taken to the ground and told to stand up straight and not move. He was put in a chokehold and held down for about two minutes before being taken to the hospital. "I was trying to get my legs up. I was trying to get my arms up. I was trying to get my head up. I was trying to get my arms up," he said. The police department has not responded to CNN's request for comment. The protests have spread nationwide, with demonstrations and demonstrations in the state capital of Raleigh.
 It was a harrowing glimpse into the mind of a young man who was watching the world through a glass darkly. "I'm afraid that my world is ending," he told his girlfriend, who was in the audience. "I'm afraid that I'm going to be alone forever. ... I'm afraid that my parents are going to kill me." It was the first time in his life he felt fear, he said.

Here are some of the big stories that are shaping up to be some of the most exciting and transformational moments in our lives this year. 1. Transforming the way we look at race In a world where race is often used as a proxy for class, this year will be different. It will be a time of unprecedented political engagement by people of color. This will be a watershed year for the civil rights movement, with demonstrations across the US and around the globe.

 In the Black Lives Matter movement, immigrants find themselves in a tough position, as well. A recent Pew Research poll found that 44% of white Americans said immigrants from other countries should be allowed to stay in the country if they pay a $1.25 billion settlement. But a majority of immigrants -- 61% -- said they would be afraid to return home. That's not to say that no one is turning away from the movement to have the country more like it. Some say they are leaving because they can't feel safe in their communities. "When you look at the world that we live in now, we are very much in the political moment of the last several months," says Jonathan Gray, a political science professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. "The people that we have to protect ourselves are also leaving us."
 They say they're protesting police brutality. They're also angry that the police force is "just as bad" as the black community, which they say has been the target of excessive force and discriminatory policing. But the Black Lives Matter protesters have been proven right. They say they're tired of seeing a country that has been a target for their activism. They want to make their voices heard. So they've decided to take a stand. "We are not going to go back to the status quo," said Darryl "D.J." Johnson, a protester and president of the St. Louis NAACP. "We are going to make the country better." Johnson said that while some protesters might be disappointed with the outcome of the election, they are hopeful that the change that they want to see in America is inevitable. "The revolution is not yet complete," Johnson said. "But we are getting there. We are getting closer." The day began with a candlelight vigil to honor the victims of the deadly police shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown. The march was meant to mark the anniversary of the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown. Johnson said that while they were protesting, he had heard the phrase "black lives matter." "It's a slogan that means that the lives of black people matter. It's a set of principles that we believe in. We are going to continue to fight for them," he said. "We are going to continue to fight for the rights of black people." Johnson said he wants to see a "transformation" in the way police interact with the black community. He said the Black Lives Matter movement has been able to gain traction because of the use of social media. "People are emboldened to speak up, to protest," he said. "I believe that is the only way that we can make a real change in the world." The protesters had been planning for months to protest in the streets. They wanted to create a "national conversation" on police brutality and systemic racism. On Friday night, protesters marched from Ferguson's S.E. corner to the White House. They held signs and carried black flags. CNN's Jim Acosta was one of the first journalists to cover the protests. He said he saw some of the protests firsthand. "I was on the ground for about an hour and a half, and it was very tense," he said. "People were getting shot in the face with plastic bullets. And it was pretty emotional." Acosta said that while he did not witness any violence, he saw a protester being shot in the head. "The person I saw was dead, and it was a result of being shot in the head by police officers," he said. "So it's a very tragic outcome. And it was something that happened in the aftermath of the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown, and it's something that we all need to be aware of." A group of protesters gathered outside of the White House on Saturday, CNN affiliate WCCO reported. They chanted "No justice, no peace" and "Black lives matter." In New York City, protesters gathered in Manhattan's Bryant Park, CNN affiliate NY1 reported. The protesters were demanding that the police department end its use of "stop and frisks" -- a practice that police sometimes use to stop people in the street for alleged crimes. "This is not a protest about police brutality," one demonstrator told the station. "It's about police brutality in general." The protest was part of a nationwide Black Lives Matter protest. In Washington, protesters gathered outside the White House. They wore black and carried signs that read, "Black lives matter," CNN affiliate WJLA reported. In Chicago, demonstrators also carried a banner that read, "No justice, no peace." Chicago police said the protesters were demonstrating against what they called a "pattern of brutality." "We stand with the people of Chicago. We stand with the people of Missouri," Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said in a statement. "We stand with the people of Ferguson and St. Louis. We stand with the people of all communities that have

 People are tweeting about Black Lives Matter now more than at any point in the movement's history," said Chris Ware, director of the Center for the Study of Race and Politics at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. "It's become a very direct and sustained response to the killing of George Floyd and it's using that as a vehicle for its message." It's also not hard to see why. The Black Lives Matter movement has been a major force in the wake of police violence and systemic racism in the United States, which has been at the center of international attention. The movement has drawn inspiration from the Black Lives Matter movement in other countries, as well as the Black Lives Matter protests in the United States. "The Black Lives Matter movement is very much a global phenomenon, and that is reflected in the way that it's being run," said Ware. "There are Black people all over the world who are taking the lead role in the movement." It's also worth noting that the Black Lives Matter movement has not been without its controversies. The group was criticized for not having a clear leadership structure. But in recent months, the group has been able to build a more cohesive, if not quite unified, front. The group has changed its name several times in recent years, but it remains the same organization.

 All Lives Matter protesters re-enacted George Floyd's death as a Black Lives Matter march went by   Thursday, August 13, 2017, the day after the killing of Floyd in Minneapolis. Police said Floyd was interfering with their investigation of the case, which was being handled by the same officers. The officers were fired last week.  CNN's Chris Cillizza, reporting from New York, said that the officers who were fired last week had been seen on video at the scene of the killing and were "dressed in full riot gear" before the event was set to begin. CNN's Geoff Bennett said that the New York Police Department has launched an internal investigation into the death of Floyd. The officers were not wearing body cameras, Bennett said. CNN's Ali Velshi reported that Floyd was shot on the ground by an officer after he allegedly spit at him. The officer was not charged in the death. The New York Police Department has said that Floyd was acting aggressively toward officers. His death comes as protests around the country are being watched closely by the public and police departments. Floyd, a black man, was shot by Minneapolis police in the back of the neck on Thursday night as he lay dying from a gunshot wound to his head. The officer, Derek Chauvin, was charged with murder on Friday. Floyd's death has sparked protests across the country in recent days as demonstrators have demanded justice for Floyd, a 43-year-old father of six. Floyd was shot in the back as he lay on the ground, handcuffed, after he was shot by police. Police said that Floyd spit at officers before he was shot.  CNN's Jake Tapper said that protesters have been wearing masks and carrying weapons in the streets. "I'm told that they are also carrying weapons and masks, and that's where the violence is coming from," he said. "And I think that's a good thing, because we're trying to find out what happened there." CNN's Sara Sidner said that it's a "very tense time" in the country. "I think that's why we're seeing it. And it's why the protests are being watched very closely, because there's a lot of tension between police and the communities that they're supposed to serve and protect," she said. "And that tension can lead to violence." CNN's Jim Acosta said that it's "very difficult" for him to understand why protesters are "not having a conversation" with police about how they can prevent violence from happening. "I understand that. I'm also not surprised that the police are not having that conversation," he said. "The police have said that in the past. And I understand that. It's very difficult for all of us to understand why that has not happened." CNN Political Analyst Van Jones said that it's a "very complex situation." "There's a lot of nuance in it. There's a lot of gray area. There's a lot of gray areas that you have to navigate," he said. "And I think it's going to be a very, very, very, very, difficult conversation for all of us to have." CNN Political Analyst Van Jones said that the protests are a "very divisive issue" and that "it's going to be very hard for people to come to terms with one another." "The way I look at it is this: People are upset because they feel like they're being mistreated," he said. "But we can't have a conversation about how to treat our neighbors because we're not all the same." CNN Political Analyst Van Jones said that there's a "huge amount of pent up anger" and "tension and tension" that can lead to violence. "The way I look at it is this: The way to get out of this is not to go around in the streets and make a scene

 The $1 trillion deal is the largest ever trade agreement between the US and China, and could bring billions of dollars in new jobs and economic growth. But it also risks undermining US sovereignty and could lead to a new war between the two superpowers. Here's what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. 1. Trade negotiations The US and China are expected to reach a deal on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a massive Pacific Rim trade deal that could be the most significant in US history. The deal, which is expected to be negotiated in secret, is expected to contain strict intellectual property protections for US companies and could pave the way for US-based companies to dominate Asia's biggest economy. But it could also be derailed by US lawmakers and the courts. The US already has a lengthy, highly-controversial agreement with 11 other countries that would cover areas like cars, agriculture, pharmaceuticals, aerospace, chemicals, food, financial services, and medical devices. The US is also negotiating an agreement with 10 other countries to protect intellectual property. 2. Russia investigation The FBI has opened an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election, a senior US official told CNN. The official said it was the first time that the FBI has opened a counterintelligence investigation into the matter. The probe is looking into allegations that Russia tried to interfere in the election and sought to influence the outcome. 3. North Korea North Korea's threats The isolated regime has issued a series of threats against the US and South Korea. Pyongyang says it will attack the US and South Korea with nuclear weapons if it attacks the US or its allies. The threats come as both nations brace for an imminent sixth nuclear test. 4. Brexit The UK's Brexit negotiations are set to begin this week, with the first phase of negotiations expected to take between two and six months. Brexit Secretary David Davis said he expects to conclude the deal by the end of March. The UK has asked to leave the European Union ahead of a planned June 23 deadline. But the EU has said it will not allow the UK to leave without a deal. 5. Trump The President has been in office for less than a month, but already the damage has already been done. His inauguration was marred by chaos and protests, and the first days of his presidency were marked by his bizarre tweets and frequent feuds with the media. He has already sparked international outcry with his incendiary comments about the First Amendment and the First Lady's looks. BREAKFAST BROWSE People are talking about these. Read up. Join in.

 A new national poll from CNN and the Kaiser Family Foundation shows that while support for President Trump has grown since the election, it's still not enough for Democrats to take back the Senate. Fifty-six percent of Democrats say they would vote for Republicans in 2018, compared to 37% who would vote for Democrats. Among Republicans, support for Trump's agenda is lukewarm. Sixty-one percent say they would vote for the president, but only 26% say they would vote for Democrats. Trump's unpopularity also doesn't help Democrats much, with 41% saying they would vote for a third-party candidate in 2020. Meanwhile, more than six in ten Democrats say they would support a third-party candidate in 2020. Trump's popularity also hasn't helped Democrats much, with 51% saying they would vote for someone else in 2020. While Democrats are still focused on the 2018 midterms, the president's unpopularity has started to hurt them in other areas. Fifty-one percent of Republicans say the economy will take a major hit if they don't enact tax reform before the end of the year, while fewer than half of Democrats say that. And a majority of Republicans say that the nation's infrastructure is in bad shape, as well. All that said, there are still bright spots for Democrats in the poll. Fifty-three percent of Democrats say the economy is doing fine, compared to 36% who say it's "very good" or "excellent." And just over half say they would vote for a third-party candidate in 2020, with just over a third saying they would vote for a third-party candidate in 2020. That said, there are still areas where Democrats could use the boost. More than six in ten say

 This couple's wedding first look happened in front of a Black Lives Matter protest. It was a celebration of love and a call to action. "It was beautiful," she said. "And I'm glad that they chose to participate in it. It was a great way to start the day." "It was so powerful and moving to see so many people together."
 The father-of-six, who was killed in a hail of bullets, was known to police and federal investigators as the man they called the "Black Lives Matter killer." He had a long list of possible crimes, but investigators believe he was most likely behind the killing of Michael Oehme, a 38-year-old bank teller who had been shot to death in his apartment earlier this month. "We have no idea what happened in his past," said Greg Stivers, the attorney representing Oehme's family. "He had a history of mental illness and violence and was on the run for years." But Oehme's family, and the officers involved in his death, say they believe the police account. "They've tried to paint him as a killer, but we don't believe that," said Oehme's brother, Christopher Oehme, adding that they believe the officers were responding to a call from a neighbor who said a man was breaking car windows and pouring gasoline on their street. "There's no evidence that he was violent in any way," Oehme said. "He was a nice, loving guy who was very respectful of his elders and very family-oriented." In a statement Thursday night, Oehme's family said they were "heartbroken and angry" at the actions of the police and FBI. "Mr. Oehme was a loving and caring person who was deeply respected by his peers and family," the family said. "He was respected by his community for his caring nature, and for his love of music and dancing." The officers involved in his death were placed on administrative leave. The officers involved in his death are white. "We are in shock, angry and saddened by the events of this morning," said Oehme's sister, Traci Oehme, in a statement. "We want the community to know that we will not rest until justice prevails." The family members said the officer involved in his death was not wearing a body camera. The video from the body camera is not publicly available, but Oehme's family said it shows the officer firing eight shots, striking Oehme eight times. The family members said Oehme was shot eight times. "The police officer did not have to shoot Mr. Oehme. He shot him because he was a threat to him," said Christopher Oehme. "The police officer did not have to shoot him. He shot him because he was a threat to himself." The family members said they would release more details about the investigation on Tuesday.
 Oehme, who was black, was shot seven times by police in the early morning hours

 On Wednesday, the Justice Department will release a video showing the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. The Justice Department said the video will be made public later this week. The video shows the moment a Ferguson police officer shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown, and the aftermath, including the struggle between Brown and the officer. The Justice Department said it will release the video in the "near future." "This is a crucial moment in the history of race relations in America. It will be a seminal moment in the history of race relations in the United States," said Attorney General Loretta Lynch. "It will show the world the painful reality of race relations in America. It will also help bring to light some of the injustices that still plague our world." The release of the video comes after a year of protests, culminating in the "Black Lives Matter" protests,

 Cyclist caught on video assaulting 3 people posting flyers in support of Black Lives Matter arrested in connection with the incident, police said. The video, which was obtained by CNN, was recorded by a bystander and shared on social media.
 It's a photo of a young black man holding up a sign that says, "I can't breathe." It's a message that's been shared on Twitter more than 200,000 times. It's the kind of message that's been a part of the American psyche since the day we were born. It's the message that's been on our lips for years. And it's the message that's being sent right now. The photo was sent to CNN by a man who asked to remain anonymous. He says he lives in a small town in Mississippi and says he's not worried about what the young man is doing. "I don't care. He's doing what he's doing. He's not threatening my people. He's not threatening anybody's people," he said. "I'm sorry. I'm not surprised. I just feel like it's an innocent act. Like I said, I just feel like it's the right thing to do." 'He's not threatening my people' The young man in the photo is not the first person to draw attention to the young black man's message. In 2014, a 19-year-old college student from Missouri, named Tanishia Covington, drew attention to the young black man's message when she posted a photo of a sign she'd made for a protest in her hometown of Columbia, Missouri. The sign read: "I can't breathe." Covington's post went viral and received widespread attention, garnering support from people who said that she was making a statement about the power of the young black men who have been killed by police.

 Black Lives Matter protests aren't just happening in big cities. They're also in America's small towns and rural areas. There are several reasons people are taking to the streets. One is that they're angry about what they see as a lack of police accountability in the aftermath of the Michael Brown case in Ferguson, Missouri. Another is that they want to protest the actions of the federal government and other authorities. But one thing that's clear is that the protests are taking on an entirely different tone. It's no longer about the actions of a few rogue officers. It's now about the actions of the many, who are increasingly showing that they are not interested in the rights and freedoms of black people. Some of that change is already being felt. For example, the protests in Chicago and New York have seen a significant decline in violence. But the city's black and brown communities are still feeling the effects of years of neglect and abuse. So it's no surprise that people are taking to the streets. They're no longer afraid to be themselves. It's no longer a black-and-white issue. It's now a color-of-life issue.
 The young man, who was not identified, was shot and killed by a police officer in an apparent "malicious" act. The shooting was captured on a body camera. The video was posted on Facebook. It was shot by a bystander who was also inside the car. The officer, who is white, has been charged with first-degree murder. CNN has reached out to the man's family and their attorney, but has not heard back. His brother said the video of the shooting shows that the young man was shot with a Taser. "This man was like a puppy, you know? He had nothing to lose," the man's brother, Thomas Thomas, told CNN. "He was trying to get away from a dog. He was shot by a police officer." Police Chief: No video of officer's fatal shooting of teen 'since October' Chief Janee Harteau of the Minneapolis police department told reporters Friday that she could not comment on the video of the shooting. She said the video is part of the investigation and will be released "at the appropriate time." "I can say that this officer's actions, including the use of a Taser, were consistent with the policies that we have to follow as law enforcement officers," she said. "And he did not violate those policies." The officer is white, the man is black. The video shows the teen walking away from officers as he's shot. He doesn't appear to be trying to run away. The officers follow him, trying to arrest him, who is heard saying, "I can't breathe." The officers then fire multiple shots, striking the teen multiple times. "I don't want to see this kid's picture," said Thomas Thomas. "I want to see him face to face and I want to hear his side of the story. I want to know what happened that day." The officer's attorney said the teen was shot by a police officer because he was trying to flee. "This is a black kid that was walking home from a convenience store to a football game with his mom and he was shot by a police officer because he was trying to run," attorney Keith Kerkow told CNN's "AC360." "And that cop got away with it because he was afraid of him." A police union official said the officers were not responding to a report of a suspicious person when they were confronted by the teen. "There is no video of this incident," Mark Jamieson, a spokesman for the union, said in a statement. "It was captured on a body camera by a bystander and the officer involved in the incident was not wearing a body camera." The officer who shot the teen, James Forcia, was

 This week, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a case that could decide the future of voting rights for millions of Americans. The justices will decide whether to hear the case from the bench or hear it from the nation's highest court. The case, Shelby County v. Holder, concerns the 2014 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals to hold off on hearing a lawsuit brought by the Black Lives Matter activist, who contends that the 2014 Shelby County Voting Rights Act, which the court declared unconstitutional, violated the rights of African-Americans. The court's decision to hold off on hearing the case will be a victory for activists who have pressed on for months to have the ruling applied to all 50 states. The justices will hear arguments in the case, which will be the first time since the mid-1990s that voting rights have come up in the high court's docket. "It is a victory for all Americans and particularly for Black Lives Matter activists," said activist DeRay Mckesson. "The Court's decision today is a victory for everyone who has fought for the right to vote, especially Black women and girls who have been disproportionately impacted by the Court's failure to protect their right to vote."

 Police searching for cyclist who was filmed accosting people posting signs supporting Black Lives Matter, police say they found him. "They didn't find him. They found a guy who tried to kill somebody," he said. "So the question is, what happened to the guy that tried to kill somebody?" In a statement, the NYPD said officers "found a man who they believe to be responsible for this attack." The NYPD said he was shot and killed. Officers were "assassassinated" when they tried to arrest the man, it said. "This was a man who they thought was going to kill them, not only because of their race but also because of their profession," Mayor Bill de Blasio said. "They were shot and killed by a man they thought was a killer." Police have said the man was a "lone wolf" attacker, but a video captured by witnesses shows the man only a few feet away from the officers. "I was on the phone with my girlfriend, she was screaming, 'Get him! Get him!'" one witness said on CNN. "I didn't see any gun or any other weapon." The mayor and de Blasio said the man's behavior at the scene is being investigated by the NYPD and the FBI. "It is clear that he was not the person that police believed," de Blasio said. "This is not a race issue. This is a human being issue." Protesters have been demanding justice for Floyd, an unarmed black man who was killed by a white police officer in Brooklyn in March. The mayor said he had reached out to Floyd's family to see if they wanted to be part of the protests. "I want to make sure that the family gets the care that they need," de Blasio said. "I want to make sure that the NYPD gets the care that they need, and we want to make sure that the community understands that there are consequences to this type of action."

The controversy over whether the Confederate flag should be taken down at the University of Virginia ended this week with a simple vote. The campus flag was taken down by the university's Board of Visitors. The University of Virginia had been the subject of a number of controversies in recent years, most recently in the aftermath of the "Unite the Right" protests that began in Charlottesville in 2017. The University of Virginia has been under fire since white nationalists, anti-Semites and neo-Nazis clashed with counter-protesters in the city in the wake of the "Unite the Right" rally. Protests were also held at the university's state Capitol in the wake of the "Unite the Right" rally in Charlottesville, which saw a man killed by a group of counter-protesters.
 The University of Virginia has asked that it remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from its campus. The controversial statue, which sits in the heart of Charlottesville, has drawn protests and controversy for years. It was erected in 1884 by an anti-racist activist who was angry that the statue of Confederate General Stonewall Jackson had been relocated from a park in downtown Charlottesville. The statue's removal comes amid a national debate over Confederate monuments and symbols. Here's what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door.

 Sacramento elementary school violated free speech by censoring Black Lives Matter posters, ACLU says. "The ACLU is concerned that the police killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, has unleashed a wave of racial violence across the country," said Ali Abunimah, the ACLU of Southern California's legislative advocate. "Free speech doesn't mean protecting the First Amendment rights of people of color, it means suppressing their voices and their power." The ACLU of Southern California filed a lawsuit Thursday against the city of Louisville, Kentucky, where the school district is located. The lawsuit alleges the school district has a "pattern of exercising an overwhelming power and authority" over the curriculum and exercises of power over student conduct. "The ACLU of Southern California is deeply concerned about the chilling effects of these policies on young people's right to free expression and assembly, and on the safety of the community at large," the lawsuit says. "The ACLU is particularly concerned about the chilling effect on students of color who are already at risk for being victims of police violence and other forms of brutality. Students of color are particularly vulnerable to the effects of the school's policies." The ACLU of Southern California also is suing the city of Louisville, Kentucky, over its school's policy of prohibiting students of color from wearing face masks. The lawsuit says the policy "undermines the legitimate exercise of First Amendment rights guaranteed by the Constitution, and abridges their First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and assembly guaranteed by the Second Amendment."
 "I was very disappointed," he said of the police killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown. "I felt like I was watching my back, because the police officers were very professional. They came in with the right amount of force, but they did not use a gun, they used a Taser." He said he had no regrets about shooting the video. "It's the right thing to do. It was the right thing to do. It was the right thing to do for the right reasons," he said. "You can't take a life, you can't take a life without being affected by the consequences of that decision." Brown was unarmed when he was shot and killed by a white police officer on August 9, 2014, in Ferguson, Missouri. Police say he was holding a BB gun when he was shot. The autopsy found that Brown was shot eight times and six of those shots were fatal. Brown's family said he was unarmed when he was shot. A grand jury decided not to indict the officer involved in the killing, but the case became a focal point in the Black Lives Matter movement. The officer who killed Brown has been fired. His gun was later used in a protest in which a black man was shot by police. The officer who killed Brown is not being charged. His attorney claims he was justified in his use of force. The officer who killed Brown has not been charged. The video of the shooting was released publicly after a judge ordered it be made public. The officer who killed Brown was not charged.

 Released NYPD emails show extensive surveillance of Black Lives Matter protesters, protesters say New York City police are increasingly using surveillance video to determine who is a criminal threat and who should be arrested, according to emails obtained by The New York Times. Police have sent out memos to field offices instructing them to monitor demonstrations. But the emails show that the NYPD is not without its own issues with the process of determining who is a criminal threat. "We have been out in the streets for the last few days, and have been out in the street with people's faces on cameras, and we have been out in the street with cameras recording people's actions and video. This is not the way we do things in this city," a top NYPD official wrote to another NYPD official. "The way we do things here is with cameras in the street and on the police cars. We are not out there with cameras because we don't want to jeopardize our relationship with our communities, and we don't want to be seen as being outside of it." The memos, first reported by The New York Times, raise concerns that the NYPD is attempting to move beyond its reliance on police cars and start using technology to determine who is a criminal threat and who should be arrested. They also raise concerns that the NYPD is becoming less transparent about the surveillance it conducts. "We have been out in the streets and have seen people's faces on cameras," one officer wrote in an email. "I am not sure what the purpose of these cameras is. Is it to record and evaluate the actions of police officers? Or is it to protect the lives of innocent bystanders? If it is protecting innocent bystanders, I am concerned about it." The memos also raise questions about the role of the independent monitor, a police force that has been criticized for its inability to hold officers accountable. The independent monitor, a former officer who is not employed by the NYPD, is tasked with reviewing police conduct and whether there are patterns of excessive or deadly force. The process is supposed to be transparent and open, and he or she has been criticized for being stonewalled by police and the NYPD. In one email, a top NYPD official complained that he had been forced to hand over videos from his body camera. "We are not allowed to release any of the videos except to say that we have made an effort to release them under the Freedom of Information Act," the email states. The memos come amid a national debate over the role of police in American society and the use of force. The New York Police Benevolent Association is demanding the resignation of NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill, who is their leader, and Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has said that the city is in the midst of a "tough talk" against racial profiling.
 The protests have spread beyond Ferguson, where the shooting death of unarmed teen Michael Brown triggered a "Black Lives Matter" movement.

 Black Lives Matter activist fatally shot while biking late at night in New Orleans "I think it's a sad day when a police officer is killed in a police encounter, especially when he or she is unarmed," he said. "It's something that we have to fight against."
 It's a good thing that the protests are mostly peaceful. It would be a sad day, though, if they weren't. And in many cases, that's exactly what's happening. This weekend, a Dallas cop was killed by a sniper who had been drinking.  A protester was killed by a man who had been taunting her for months. In Chicago, a man was killed by a man who had been drinking and driving. And in New York City, a police officer was killed by a man who had been drinking and smoking.  And in other cities, people are dying in the streets and their city is being swamped by police officers and protesters. Some of those deaths were preventable, some were not. And it's all happening in the name of "justice." On Sunday night, protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, turned into peaceful protesters, and police responded with tear gas and rubber bullets. But in many places, it looked like things were going to get worse before they got better. The same protesters who were protesting are now demanding that the police officers be charged with his death. And they're not happy about it. "It's not just about the police being held accountable. It's about the people getting out of their cars and not being targeted for their race, their religion, their gender, for their disability," says Brittany Covington, a protester who lives in Ferguson. She says she doesn't see how it's any different than what happened in Ferguson. "The police are not above the law, they're above the Constitution, and they need to be held accountable for their actions," she says. 'A series of missteps' The protests in Ferguson are a perfect storm of missteps for the police. One, the protests are largely peaceful, and the police are making a lot of noise. Two, the protests are largely peaceful. And three, the police have made a lot of noise. But the protests have also cost thousands of dollars in damages. A grand jury has been empaneled to investigate the shooting of Michael Brown, the deaths of other black men by police, and the ongoing controversy over how police handle and respond to protests. All that's on top of the fact that protesters have been shot and killed by police. This weekend, the protests were even more tense as some protesters were arrested. Demonstrators in Boston were seen being led by police into a police precinct.  In Los Angeles, protesters were met with a mix of tear gas and pepper spray. In New York City, police used batons and plastic bullets to disperse a crowd of about 20,000. And in Chicago, police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse a crowd of about 1,000. All that's going to add up to a much larger number of deaths in the streets this weekend than the police report says.
 It was a political decision. It was a moral choice. It was a choice between two futures. In a city that's already seen its share of violence, the mayor decided to make the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown a symbol of change. He decided to send a message to young people who had been disillusioned by the violence that had rocked the city over the past few months. And he chose to send a clear message to the black community that he was not here to be a bystander. "We all have the power to change the course of events that we see happening in our city," he said. "I'm asking you to take a second to reflect on the choices you have made today, and then reflect on those choices again." "I will be the first to say that this choice was not easy," he said. "But I'm asking you to

 Why a high school that's just 5% black is raising the Black Lives Matter flag  A high school that's just 5% black, and who's really trying to do the right thing? The answer, of course, is no. The NAACP has long been a target of white conservatives who don't want the organization to be seen as supporting black causes. But in recent years, they've changed their tune. They've become more vocal in supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, which has become a top-tier national movement with high-profile celebrities like Beyoncé and Laverne Cox. Some of this has to do with the fact that they're raising money for Black Lives Matter. "It's not just about the politics of it. It's about the people's right to be heard," said Erica Wilson, a founding member of the NAACP's Board of Directors. "There's a lot of white people who are afraid of that kind of activism." A lot of the white backlash against the Black Lives Matter movement has to do with the fact that they want to be seen as the allies of black Americans. And many white conservatives don't want to be seen as being racist or bigots. "It's not just about the politics of it. It's about the people's right to be heard," said Wilson, who is black.

It's the latest in a series of high-profile cases that have brought attention to the plight of the black community. A civil rights investigation into the fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014 resulted in the release of dashcam video showing the fatal encounter. A year later, a grand jury in New York declined to indict a white police officer in the death of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who was allegedly choked by a white police officer. The case sparked protests across the nation and a national conversation about the role of police in society. "It's a win for the people, but it's also a win for the police officers," Bouie said. "It's a win for everyone involved, but especially the officers."
 "When you're having the conversation, it's not just about race. It's about the police officer, the communities, the families, the community," he

 Baton Rouge officer sues Black Lives Matter over 2016 ambush of cops

The city's police chief says he's filing a lawsuit against the city, its police department and its former chief.

In a lawsuit filed Friday, the city of Ferguson and the city of St. Louis say they are seeking class-action status in a class-action lawsuit. The suit claims the city has failed to adequately train, equip and equip its police officers with body cameras, body cameras that record officer-involved shootings, as required by state and federal law. Ferguson and St. Louis say the suits are without merit. "This is a blatant attempt to take away our right to due process, and to put us in a legal class where we are forced to defend ourselves against baseless and frivolous lawsuits," Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said in a statement. "We will vigorously defend our officers' rights to wear body cameras, and we will vigorously defend our officers' rights to have their videos recorded." Attorney General Mike Ferguson says the suit is "basically just a political stunt." He says the state's attorney general is investigating the city's response to the shooting of Michael Brown, the unarmed black teenager who sparked outrage in Ferguson and elsewhere after he was killed by a white police officer. Ferguson and St. Louis say they're seeking more than $50 million in damages.

 Police say they will put up a "Black Lives Matter" flag in the same location. CNN affiliate KATV-TV reported the White House is also putting up a "Black Lives Matter" flag on the South Lawn. "The flag controversy is a political statement and not a statement about what we stand for. We are working with local officials to find a way to bring awareness to this important conversation and ensure that the flag controversy does not distract from our work to make sure all lives matter," White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in a statement.
 "I'm going to keep talking about it, but we're not going to do that here," Missouri Rep. John Lewis said. "We're going to take a stand. We're going to march, and we're going to protest."  The White House statement came as demonstrators in several cities converged on the White House to protest the deaths of unarmed black men by police. Protests were also held across the nation. In New York, thousands of demonstrators gathered at a protest site in Manhattan, while in Chicago, thousands marched from the UIC Pavilion to the White House. Demonstrators also took to the streets in Atlanta, Baton Rouge, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, Minneapolis and Seattle.  In Washington, protesters gathered near the White House and in front of the Capitol building. CNN affiliate WTOP reported demonstrators held a "Black Lives Matter" banner and chanted slogans like "Say Her Name" and "Black lives matter." In Baton Rouge, demonstrators marched through downtown and downtown to a park where they were met with chants of "No justice, no peace!" and "No KKK, no KKK." "We are all a bunch of people here trying to do the right thing, and I think that we can all agree that the right thing is not being done," Baton Rouge resident A.C. "A.C." Wilson said. In Seattle, thousands of demonstrators took to the streets. "Seattle is home to the Black Lives Matter movement. We wanted to show support for our community and fight racism and police brutality in our own backyard," the group said on its website. In Miami, hundreds of demonstrators held a protest at the same spot where demonstrators were met with clashes with police. In New York, hundreds of protesters marched through Manhattan, chanting "Black lives matter." In Chicago, about 150 protesters marched from the scene of a shooting to a park near the White House. The march ended at a park near the Lincoln Memorial. In New Orleans, hundreds of demonstrators marched through the city's downtown core, according to the National Lawyers Guild. In Boston, protesters gathered at the intersection of Boylston and 11th streets. Boston police said they were planning to deploy National Guardsmen to the scene. In Atlanta, demonstrators in the city's city limits were met with a large police presence, CNN affiliate WSB reports. "Atlanta police say they will deploy at least a half-dozen National Guard units to the city's downtown core as part of a "temporary" deployment in response to protests that continue," the city's mayor said. "The National Guard will remain in the city until a later date," he added.

 'Black Lives Matter' cases: What happened after controversial police killings of unarmed black men? 'I've been called all the names in the book' The NAACP's calls for a boycott of Target have been met with a chorus of protest. The company said it will not sell clothing or accessories made by the retailer, which has also been criticized for its support of Black Lives Matter. "Target is a target, and we're not going to stand for it," the company tweeted. "We will not stand by while others are harmed or killed because of the color of their skin. Black lives matter." But many Black people see the boycott as a symbol of the growing divide between the Black community and mainstream America. "It's becoming increasingly clear that this is a very American thing to boycott and protest," said Adam Clayton, a political science professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. "It's a way of saying 'I'm not buying your product.' " This isn't the first time the NAACP has faced backlash over the Black Lives Matter movement. The organization has faced backlash over the "unarmed black man" movement, which has been criticized for its call for the end of violence against African-Americans. In the 1980s, the NAACP stopped selling T-shirts that said "Black Lives Matter" after protests against police brutality.

 'Black Lives Matter' cases: When controversial killings lead to change, we ask why
 The protests have been building in the United States since the death of George Floyd. The protests have been led by the phrase "Black Lives Matter" and have been seen as an expression of the struggles of Black people in the US. But some say it is an outdated term that misses the larger issue of police brutality against people of color. Some say it is a form of white supremacy that is exploiting the protests and playing on racial tensions to gain power. Here are some of the protests and what they mean. Ferguson, Missouri Protesters have been gathering in Ferguson since the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown. The protests have been seen as an expression of the struggles of Black people in the US. But some say it is an outdated term that misses the larger issue of police brutality against people of color. The "Black Lives Matter" movement started in the wake of the Michael Brown case in Ferguson, Missouri. It is now seen as a white nationalist movement that plays on racial tensions. Black Lives Matter is a "political statement" and not a statement of "objective reality," says Ali Velshi, a professor of English at the University of California-Davis. "It is a political statement that is not based on objective reality, so it is not a statement about what is happening in real life," he says. "It is not a statement of what is happening in the world." The term "Black Lives Matter" is often used in a political context, though it does not necessarily mean the same thing as it does when used in a literal sense. "It's a statement of a set of principles that comes together in a very clear and effective way to say that black lives do matter," says Maya Torri, a writer and activist. "It's a statement of a set of demands that are being put forward in an organized way and that is powerful." The "Black Lives Matter" protests have been a part of a broader movement that is also calling for social justice. The term has been used to describe a broad range of social justice issues, including police brutality, structural racism, environmental racism and anti-blackness. "Black Lives Matter is not a political statement," says Torri. "It's a statement of a set of demands." Protesters in Portland, Oregon, have been demanding police reform and the end of police brutality for months. They have been protesting against the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor for months. On Sunday, they held a candlelight vigil in front of the US Capitol building in front of the White House. The protest was part of a wider campaign to call for a more just society. "We are here to say that black lives do matter," Torri says. "We are here to say that black lives matter. We are here to say that black lives matter. And we are here to say that black lives matter." Protesters in New York City have been staging sit-ins and rallies for months. They have demanded that the city's police department and other city departments end racial profiling and police brutality. They have also called for the arrest of NYPD officers involved in the deaths of Eric Garner and NYPD Officer Daniel Pantaleo. On Sunday, the city's mayor, Bill de Blasio, called for calm. "As we continue to see images of violence between police and citizens, it is clear that New York City's police officers are not the only face of the city's black community," he said. "The city's black and brown community needs a mayor who is willing to listen and who is willing to listen to their pain and anger." Protests in Los Angeles and Washington, DC Demonstrations in both cities have been taking place since the death of George Floyd. The protests have been seen as an expression of the struggles of Black people in the US. But some say it is an outdated term that misses the larger issue of police brutality against people of color. "It's not a political statement, it's a statement of a set of principles that are going to be put forth in a clear and effective way," says Torri. "It's not a statement of what's happening in real life. It's a statement of what's in the future and what's coming to the future." One protest in Los Angeles took place Sunday night. Organizers said the purpose of the event was to "reclaim our city and reclaim our streets." The event was organized by the Los Angeles Black Lives Matter chapter. "The mission of the Los Angeles Black Lives Matter chapter is to educate, organize and empower the black community in support of the issues that matter most: racial justice, economic equality, social justice, the right to health care, the end of police brutality, and a climate where all people of color feel safe and valued," the group said on its website. "We are proud to be a part of the Los Angeles Black Lives Matter chapter." Protests in Washington, DC have been taking place since the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black

 Police: No link between Chicago torture video and Black Lives Matter protests

Chicago Police Chief Garry McCarthy said Saturday that he didn't want to see his officers' "hurt" and "maimed" by the video of the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Laquan McDonald. The officer who shot him, Jason Van Dyke, was found not guilty of first-degree murder charges on Monday, but he did not face any criminal charges in his death. The officer fired 17 shots at the teenager, killing him. "It's not fair. It's not right," McCarthy said. "It's not fair. I don't want them to be hurt or maimed by the video. I don't want them to go through this. I don't want them to be in the hospital and they don't want to go through this." Van Dyke's attorney, Ben Crump, told CNN's Don Lemon that his client was trying to use his authority to protect himself and his family. "This was a vile, vicious act," he said. "It was a calculated, premeditated murder." The officers' bodies were found Monday in a wooded area near where they were shot. They had been shot with rubber bullets and batons, but there was no evidence of a struggle, police said. 'No one should have to die' The video shows McDonald walking away from officers as he's shot. It is not clear whether he is reaching for an object. He was pronounced dead at a hospital. The video shows the officers' body camera rolling as they stand near a vehicle. It is not clear whether they are still inside that vehicle.

 A black teen, the first person to die in the city since the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown, was killed by a white police officer who'd been ambushed by a group of angry young men, police said. "It's been a very, very long time since a black person was killed by a police officer," said Salena Zayat, a sociology professor at Emory University in Georgia. "And it's

Some said the video was proof that police violence against black people is not just a problem in America. "This is a national issue," said Jason Ford, a political commentator who said the video was "very, very troubling." "We need to look at what's happening in these communities in a broader perspective.

 'Black Lives Matter' cases: What happened after the protests?  The demonstrations, which were largely peaceful, grew into a fierce debate between supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement and those who said the movement is racist and that police are using the protests as a pretext to justify their own actions. As the debate heated up, the state of Missouri saw some protests turn violent, with protesters smashing windows, looting and setting cars ablaze. While some protesters were peaceful, others clashed with police in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, which saw the deaths of unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown and unarmed 18-year-old Eric Garner. The death of the unarmed 18-year-old sparked riots in Ferguson. At least six people were arrested. In St. Louis, police said the crowds turned violent when a group of protesters threw rocks and bottles at officers. At least six people were injured, including one who suffered a broken arm.
 "The protests were supposed to be peaceful, but they turned violent," she said. "And that's not what we want our community to do." A grand jury decided not to indict Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson in the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, sparking protests and calls for his resignation. Protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, have been demanding justice for the young black man since he was shot by an officer there in August. "It's been a year since Michael Brown was killed, and the city has not made it simple," said Kathleen Zellner, a lawyer with the Legal Aid Society. "It's been a year of protests and demonstrations and protests of what happened and demonstrations of what should have happened."  "There are still people in Ferguson who have not learned the lessons of last year," she said. "And they are still waiting for the justice they deserve."  Ferguson's current police chief, Jim McNally, said he wants to see the community's involvement in the decision. "We want to be transparent with the community," he said. "And we want to do that in a way that protects the community's trust and confidence in the police department."
 "We've got to be honest with you," he said. "We don't want to be remembered as the city that they remember. We don't want to be remembered as the people that they were in 2012. We don't want to be remembered as the people that they saw in 2013. We don't want to be remembered as the people that they saw in 2014." But he did not want to use the phrase "Black Lives Matter" or "I can't breathe," which was used by protesters and police during the protests.  He also didn't want to use the term "Black Lives Matter" or "All lives matter."  "I don't want to use the phrase 'All lives matter.' I'm not trying to say that we all have to take sides in this debate, but we do have to have our own perspective," he said. "We don't have to agree with everything that's going on. We don't have to agree with everything that's happening."  And he said it was "very important for us to have our own perspective."   "I want to make it clear that we do not agree with everything that's happening in the world," he said. "We do not have to agree with everything that's happening in this world."  Ferguson Mayor James Knowles III said the city's troubles in the wake of the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown "will not be solved by one side or the other." "We have to be clear, we do not want a repeat of the events of 2012, which resulted in the death of young Michael Brown and the destruction of a great city," Knowles said. "We have to move forward, we have to move forward, we have to move forward." "The people of Ferguson have asked for peace and the city has agreed to move forward," he said. "But peace will only come when we move forward in our own direction. That's not what we want to see."  "We want to move forward, we want to move forward in our community, we want to move forward in our country, we want to move forward in our community," Knowles said. "We're not moving backward, we're moving forward."  "We want to move forward, we want to move forward in the right direction. We're not moving forward, we're moving forward. We're not moving forward, we're moving forward."  "We're not moving forward, we're moving forward," he said.  "We are moving forward, we are moving forward."  "We're moving forward, we are moving forward," he said. "We're moving forward, we're moving forward."  "We're moving forward, we're moving forward," he said.  "We're moving forward, we're moving forward."  "We are moving forward, we're moving forward," he said. "We are moving forward

 The officers involved in the shooting have been placed on administrative leave and are being investigated, police said. The investigation is ongoing. The officers' names have not been released. CNN's Chris Cillizza contributed to this report. CNN has reached out to the Department of Justice and the New York Police Department for comment. The New York Police Department has not responded to a request for comment. The officers were not in uniform when officers shot and killed a man on Wednesday night, New York Police Department Commissioner James O'Neill told reporters. He said the officers fired because they thought the man was a danger to themselves or others. CNN has not been able to independently confirm that information. The city's mayor has ordered an outside autopsy of the body of the deceased man, as well as of the officers involved. A toxicology report will be performed on the man's body, as well as on the officers' body cameras, the mayor's office said. "The police officers involved have been placed on administrative leave, the New York City Police Department will conduct an independent investigation of the incident, as required by law, and the results of that investigation will be released publicly," O'Neill said. "The officers involved have been placed on administrative leave, and their names will not be released at this time." The shooting sparked protests across the nation after the death of 18-year-old Freddie Gray, who suffered a severe spinal cord injury while in police custody in Baltimore. Gray died on April 12 after a police officer placed him in a severe restraint chair. Gray's death set off days of unrest, including a sit-in in the front of the Baltimore City Police Department. Protests also took place in other cities, including Chicago, Washington, D.C., and San Francisco. The Justice Department is investigating the death of Gray.

The protests have become a focal point for the Black Lives Matter movement. The St. Paul Police Department has not responded to CNN's request for comment. A CNN analysis of data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics shows that the proportion of African-Americans who live in St. Paul increased from 30% in 2015 to 49% in 2020. This is in line with other data. The statistics also show that African-Americans make up a smaller proportion of the population than in previous decades.
 As a result of the Justice Department's decision not to bring civil rights charges against the five officers involved in the death of 25-year-old Michael Brown, the officers have been fired and the department has been forced to make changes, including hiring a new chief of police. On Monday, the city council voted unanimously to change the police department's charter to prohibit the use of deadly force, a move that would take effect July 1. The officers will remain on the force. But the city's police chief, a former New York police officer, will be replaced by a civilian with a police background, according to city officials. The new civilian police chief will be chosen by the city's mayor and serve a four-year term, city officials said. The vote came after months of heated debate in a city where the recent unrest has led to protests in the streets for the

 The rise of Black Lives Matter: Trying to break the cycle of violence and silence The term "Black Lives Matter" is often used to refer to a broad umbrella term that includes groups of people who are disproportionately affected by police brutality and racism. But "Black Lives Matter" has also been used to describe specific groups of people who are disproportionately affected by specific types of violence. For example, the term "Black Lives Matter" is used to describe people who are disproportionately affected by police brutality and racial discrimination. The rise of the Black Lives Matter movement and the shift in public opinion has led to a shift in how we think about these issues. Many people are now thinking about these issues in broader terms, and not just in terms of race or gender. For example, sociologists have found that the way that police officers perceive and respond to violence against them can have an impact on the way they view and respond to these issues. The shift in public opinion may also be a direct result of the protests and demonstrations that have taken place across the country and around the world. People are also thinking about these issues in terms of social justice. For example, one of the first things people did after the George Floyd police shooting was to start thinking about these issues in terms of social justice, says John Sommers, an associate professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. "We are seeing a shift in public opinion in a number of ways," Sommers says. "For example, people are starting to think in terms of how the police are using the police power to exert control over people and communities." In other words, the police are no longer seen as a monolith. In the past few weeks, more and more people have started to see police officers as partners in the fight against crime and terrorism. "It is a very complex issue, and I don't want to get into the weeds," says Sommers. "But we do know that police officers are often the first to respond to calls of a person who is mentally ill, or who is having a mental health crisis," he says. "We do know that when police officers are involved in a fatal or serious incident, they often end up being the first to deploy lethal weapons. We do know that when police officers are killed, their families often don't get the information they need to know what happened." The shift in public opinion could also be a result of a change in public perception of the police. People are also beginning to understand that the police are not always the best, Sommers says. "I think we all need to be careful about what we say and do about police brutality, because that brutality could be the fuel for change," he says. "And I think it would be dangerous if we just let the police off the hook."
 For the past few weeks, the Black Lives Matter movement has been under fire from activists and politicians, who say it is hypocritical for the group to champion the rights of black people while also distancing itself from the actions of its own members. But the group says it's not about politics, it's about addressing the real issues that affect black people today. "The Black Lives Matter movement is a statement of solidarity and commitment to the liberation of black people. It's not about politics. It's about putting our lives, our futures and our future children's lives at risk," said the group's national director, D.J. Wilson. "The Black Lives Matter movement is not about the color of your skin, the color of your hair or the color of your skin as we all know it. It's about putting our lives, our futures and our children's futures at risk. The Black Lives Matter movement is not about the color of your skin, the color of your hair or the color of your skin as we all know it." On Wednesday, the group plans to hold its first-ever national convention, Wilson said. It will be held at a local high school in the city of Columbus, the group said. The convention, which will be livestreamed and streamed, will feature speeches, panels and discussions on topics including police reform, criminal justice reform, education, housing, economic and social justice, according to a press release. "The movement has been challenged in many ways over the past few years to speak truth to power, but we can't go back to the ways we were," the group said. "The way we are going to get back to the way we were is with our actions." 'We have to be clear about this' The group says it will use the convention to "defend the right to peacefully assemble and protest." "We have to be clear about this: The Black Lives Matter movement is not a political organization. We are a civil rights organization. Our goal is to defend the rights of all people of color, not just some. We are not a political movement," the group said. "We are a civil rights organization that stands for the liberation of all people. We are not a political organization that defends the rights

 Black Lives Matter activist Shaun King addresses race reports in a statement on his website. "The Black Lives Matter movement is a serious and important movement, but it is not without its flaws. It is an incredibly effective tool for speaking out against systemic racism and police brutality, but it has also been accused of using the platform of activism to further their own agenda. This is a dangerous combination, and we cannot afford to lose sight of the fact that we are all and united by the same goal of speaking out against injustice and inequality. We need to be clear about that: the Black Lives Matter movement is NOT about race. It is not about race or ethnicity. It is about the people of color who have been systematically and unfairly targeted, killed, and maimed by police. It is about all of us who feel unsafe in our communities and the need for change that we are seeing in our nation's capital. It is about standing up for what is right and not being afraid to speak up and change the conversation. This is NOT a race issue. This is a movement issue. This is about the future of our democracy." A Google search for "Shaun King" brings up more than 2,600 results. Among them is a video of an interview with CNN's Don Lemon, in which King said that the protests in Ferguson and New York City have been a "good thing." "I think it's great that people are trying to make a difference, but I think that we've got to be careful what we wish for. We can't wish away the future of our democracy," King said. "I think that Ferguson is one of the most powerful stories that's happening right now in the country, and we need to remember that. We need to remember that it's not just the young people who are being killed, it's the old people who are being killed. We need to remember that the young people are not the only ones who are affected. So it's really important that we keep trying to help those young people who are affected." King's remarks come after he and other Black Lives Matter activists have been targeted for their views on race. In a recent interview with CNN's Don Lemon, King said that he felt that people who took to the streets to protest racism and police brutality were misusing the movement's resources. "I think that the power of the Black Lives Matter movement is that it's able to shift the conversation to the real issues that are really happening right now. Because the real issues are, you know, the everyday issues that affect people of color, the issues that impact our world right now, and we need to talk about those issues in a way that's not divisive and that's not provocative," King said. "I think that the power of the Black Lives Matter movement is that it's able to do that."
 The statement from the group said the officers involved in the shooting were terminated and a disciplinary investigation was opened. "The officers' actions were not consistent with the way we expect our nation's law enforcement officers to act," the statement said. "They acted as though they were justified in the use of deadly force. They did not see the black teenager they were trying to arrest and they shot him in cold blood." The statement said the officers involved in the shooting were terminated and a disciplinary investigation was opened. "The officers involved in the shooting were terminated and a disciplinary investigation was opened," the statement said. The statement came after the parents of Trayvon Martin, who was shot and killed by George Zimmerman in 2012, demanded answers. "Why did this happen to him?" the family said in a statement. "Why was he not charged?" "Why was he not indicted? Why wasn't he charged? Where is he now?" Martin's parents said they wanted the public to know what happened and what they plan to do next. "We want answers," said Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton. "We want our son's case to be heard. We want justice. We want our son's family to know that we are not going to be silenced." The police chief, Bill Evans, and the mayor of Sanford, Joe Riley, said they would release the names of the officers involved in the shooting. Evans said he wanted to protect the privacy of the officers involved. "We have to do this in a manner that protects our community and our officers and we have to do it with the utmost care that we can," he said. Riley said he wanted to be transparent. "We can't do this in a way that is going to give the wrong impression to the community," Riley said. "We want to be clear about what happened and what we did and what we have to do to prevent this from happening again." The protests have been mostly peaceful. But one man's death Saturday night has raised concerns among some that the demonstrations could turn violent. "I think it's safe to say that there will be at least some incidents that occur in the city of Sanford, but the city is going to have a very tight grip on what happens in

 Protesters' chants of 'Black Lives Matter' echo at megamall; at least 20 arrested   The demonstration was meant to protest police brutality and the death of Freddie Gray, an unarmed black man who died last month in police custody. The police department is under fire after the death of another unarmed black man, Michael Brown, in Ferguson, Missouri. Police have said Brown was not involved in the altercation that led to Gray's death. But a grand jury in Ferguson decided not to indict the officer involved in Gray's death.  The mood was tense at the rally. Some protesters carried Black Lives Matter flags. Others wore "I can't breathe" T-shirts. At one point, a man wielding a megaphone yelled, "I can't breathe" over and over. And at another, a man wearing a "Black Lives Matter" shirt was seen yelling, "I can't breathe." There were also reports of people in riot gear. But police said they did not use tear gas. The protests come amid a national debate on the use of police force and the role of race in society. The Police Department's use of tear gas in New York City during the first night of protests was criticized as a "show of force." Police in New York City used pepper spray against protesters. The city has ordered more than 200,000 rounds of tear gas. The protests have been largely peaceful. The mayor of Baltimore, which is hosting the 2022 Winter Olympics, said police presence "will be minimal" during the games. He also said he is "hopeful" that the protests will be a "constructive" part of the Games.
