 He held three white and two black belts in karate, and he became president of the national board in 2006. He was a regular instructor at both the K-9 and the K-12 level, working mostly with children and adults. A few months after taking the job, he started training his dog to read people's faces and emotions. He found that he was becoming increasingly familiar with people he thought were "different" and "out of range," including blacks and Asians. One day last November, he met a black woman who looked to be about 30, with a long black hair cut into a ponytail and wearing an eye patch. She told him she lived in a mostly black neighborhood, and would not be surprised if he saw a black man in the street. But this woman had no intention of being his date. She walked over to his car and took out a large plastic bag and a black-hooded backpack. He walked over to her, and she took off her sunglasses and held them in front of her at gunpoint. The bag had a black Sharpie. She pointed to the black dot on the Black Lives Matter sign on the dashboard and then asked him if he had a weapon. "I did," he said. She placed a gun in the bag as well, just in case. The bag was filled with about $5 of fake cash and a small amount of heroin. The woman left when she reached home. After that, nothing had happened. After a few weeks, he got a call from someone with a fake name and who claimed he was looking to buy fake bank records and had a job waiting on a client. A few days later, he was at a house in Chicago with a phony ID and no one. It wasn't until a week later that he was home with a missing $3,300. A detective called and told Koval that he was looking for evidence that could be used to help establish his alibi. Koval quickly agreed to pay $900, to cover the cost of bringing the evidence to the Chicago Police, something she did to no avail. "There was no point of it," he said. "It just felt like the money was there." The detective went back to Koval and asked if the money had been wired through the bank. He said yes, and Koval called the number associated with the missing money, but it was too soon. About a week later, Koval got another call from someone claiming to be looking to buy the same fake bank records that had been used to establish his alibi. Again Koval agreed to pay $7,000 and return for the money, but Koval's wife came round to his house. "We need to get a court order first," she said. In a week, the court order came back for Koval and then returned the money for him. He now had a job as a lawyer and started paying rent. 'Where's the money?'' The phone rang frequently. One day Koval arrived at his family's apartment, in a white car with two black-hooded runners and a blue check that said "Dollar Shave, $4,400." The woman told him he was "going to need new ID," and that she had bought one. The couple went outside to the street and ran into the woman's boyfriend. He was there holding a manila envelope with his name and address printed onto it. "Here�s the ID," the man said, as he pointed to the manila envelope in Koval�s hand. "I just got the identification," Koval said. Inside was a copy of his driver�s license. After he got the ID, the woman called him up and asked to use his real name. Koval had his hands full thinking about the identity of his next client. He had to get the real ID, and ID could mean anything. In the first instance, of course, he couldn�t get the real ID before he entered the city from another state with a passport that had a picture and the word "real." Then at 6:45 a.m. on July 25, Koval got a call. A man calling from the West Chicago, Illinois, was asking for money. In the days that followed, there would be several. Police used the fake identifications to get people to follow them, and then to seize their money. The man told Koval some stuff about being a veteran of the United States Army. Koval was shocked.  But he also knew better than to take the call, and there was at least one place for him to stay as an inmate.  In Chicago, the police force uses "bait and switch." In Chicago, the police use aliases. But the real IDs that these criminals got were fake, meaning no one had actually gone into the actual prison. The only way to get a real ID back is to show your real one.  The first call came in late August, around 3 a.m. Koval was frantic and anxious,
