Jason Lazarus, Siebren Versteeg and Stephanie Syjuco founded Public Public Address on September 1 to help people with illnesses and disabilities participate in these protests and make their voices heard without putting their lives at risk. ""This is all about our solidarity with Black Lives Matter. We want people to be a part of the movement whether they can protest on the streets or not,"" Lazarus told CNN. ""Our goal is battling systemic racism and violence and bringing all kinds of people along with us."" Public Public Address urges people who are unable to protest in person to submit videos or photos of themselves protesting anywhere in the world. Submissions have been shot in people's homes, backyards and even beds. The site edits the submissions and weaves them together, creating one large virtual protest. It's broadcast online every day and all day with no end date in sight. The project has attracted more than 100 participants since its launch, according to Lazarus, an assistant professor of art and art history at the University of South Florida in Tampa. Lucie Duggan, a disabled and immunocompromised 16-year-old girl from Orlando, Florida, is one of the participants. She said she joined Public Public Address to take a stand against injustice. ""It is so important that everyone works as hard as they can to provide justice and equality. It's made an impact in my life by allowing me to further a cause that is so important and dire,"" Duggan told CNN.  ""Even though we can't provide our bodies to the cause, we are with the protestors in spirit. Hopefully this project encourages many able bodied people to take to the streets and demand change."" Unable to walk without a cane or wheelchair, Duggan added that protesting was never an option for her until Public Public Address was launched. As for the website's founders, they say they're just getting started. ""The end date for this project is open, as we see the upcoming presidential election as a moment to build toward even more work, outreach, visibility and racial justice,"" Versteeg told CNN."," This website helps people with illnesses and disabilities participate in Black Lives Matter protests. It also provides a platform for people to share and discuss their experiences and to build a network of support.<|endoftext|>The US Supreme Court handed down a decision Tuesday that will have a profound impact on how the country's criminal justice system deals with police misconduct cases. The justices ruled that police officers' First Amendment rights protect them from being compelled to testify in court, but that does not mean they are immune from charges of misconduct. The decision means that officers may not testify in court in cases where they have a duty to protect themselves or others. Here's what you need to know. What the decision means The decision means that the police officers who used deadly force in Ferguson, Missouri, last August will now be able to use deadly force in cases where they have a duty to protect themselves or others. In theory, that means police officers in those cases would no longer have to fear that their actions could be construed as ""contemptuous"" or ""unreasonable."" But it could also mean that police officers in some other situations could be held accountable for the actions of their officers, even though they didn't intend to kill a person. What the court said The decision in the case of the police officers involved in the fatal shooting of Michael Brown was a victory for those who said the police officers' First Amendment rights protected them from being held liable for the actions of their colleagues. But it also means that officers who kill people in police encounters could be held accountable for their actions. ""It is a victory for the First Amendment, but it's a victory for the officers involved in the killing of Michael Brown and for the communities he served,"" said Jamie Fellner, a Ferguson activist who was not involved in the case. ""It's a victory for the Constitution, but it also means that we're going to have to reevaluate the way we police",368
1,https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/26/us/texas-teacher-fired-black-lives-matter-mask-trnd/index.html, A Texas teacher was fired for wearing a Black Lives Matter face mask," Lillian White, an art teacher at Great Hearts Western Hills, a public charter school in San Antonio, began wearing a face mask that read ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""Silence is Violence"" after the charter school reopened in the summer for in-person workdays amid the coronavirus pandemic. At the time, students were not on campus. White said she wore the mask to demonstrate her support for Black students and faculty, but also to advocate for an anti-racism action plan and a more diverse curriculum. Protests over racial injustice erupted across the United States this summer after several high-profile killings of Black people by police. The Black Lives Matter movement has been central to the protests. After nearly two weeks of wearing the mask, White said she received a message from a school official asking her to stop. ""Hey. can you start bringing a different mask on campus? We don't discuss the current political climate on campus. Parents will start coming around more now,"" Heather Molder, the school's assistant headmaster, said in a text message to White, which the teacher shared with CNN. Molder did not respond to multiple requests for comment from CNN. Great Hearts Texas Superintendent Daniel Scoggin said in a statement to CNN that school policy forbids faculty from displaying messages on their face masks. ""Great Hearts enacted, in this unprecedented pandemic environment, a policy that face coverings have no external messages,"" Scoggin said. The art teacher, who has worked in education for more than 10 years, continued to wear the mask despite receiving multiple requests from school officials to stop. ""I immediately knew it was time for me to make a decision, and I didn't think twice about it. This is a human rights issue and I did it for my students who experience racial injustice in school. I refused to back down,"" White said. ""If you're scared about what parents are going to say because a teacher is supporting equal rights, you need to reevaluate the kind of people you're catering to. By staying silent, Great Hearts is only supporting racist parents."" On September 5, after a month of speaking with school and district officials on the matter and days before students returned to campus, White was told her employment was terminated for her refusal to wear a different mask. Scoggin said the school's decision was about policy and not the Black community. ""We stand with the Black community and all who are suffering. Great Hearts deplores bigotry and its crushing effects on all those subjected to it. Great Hearts is committed to an America where racism, violence, and injustice do not happen, because such acts find no home in the hearts of a great people,"" Scoggin said. White said no students or parents saw her wearing the mask in person, but that she was harassed by some parents who saw photos she posted of herself wearing the face covering on social media. Some faculty members asked if she could make them Black Lives Matter masks, White said, but none joined her fight or defended her when she was fired. White does not plan to contest her termination, but has started a petition, signed by more than 1,200 people, demanding Great Hearts to implement an anti-racism action plan."," A Texas teacher was fired for wearing a Black Lives Matter face mask. She was fired after she posted a photo of the mask on Facebook. The school said the photo was inappropriate and the teacher received the termination. And a middle school student who was suspended for wearing a Trump hat was not given a chance to appeal, the school said.
 The police department's decision to release the video -- which shows Floyd being arrested -- was a decision made by the department in a ""holistic"" investigation, Chief David Brown said Tuesday. The video shows Floyd pleading for help as he is handcuffed and taken to the ground by officers. He is then seen bleeding profusely as officers attempt to restrain him. Floyd died shortly after being taken to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead, police said. The police department has not said why Floyd died. CNN has not been able to reach the officers for comment. The video begins with Floyd being arrested for resisting arrest and has a black and white view of the arrest. It then cuts to a white view of a medical examiner's report, showing Floyd's injuries consistent with a choke hold. CNN has not been able to reach the officers for comment. The video ends with an officer saying, ""He's dead."" The officers are seen on the video standing over Floyd and he is seen being taken into custody. The police department has said Floyd died from a gunshot wound to the head. Floyd was arrested in April. He was found dead on the side of the road shortly after, police said. The autopsy report says Floyd was ""shot multiple times from a close range point of view"" and ""shot multiple times through his left front left chest cavity."" An autopsy found Floyd had methamphetamine in his system, the Hialeah police said. CNN has not been able to reach the officers for comment.
 The video shows Floyd, who was black, lying on the ground handcuffed, face down in the middle of the road, with his eyes shut, according to a criminal complaint filed Tuesday by the attorney representing the family of Floyd, John Burleson. The attorney's statement says Burleson was not aware that Floyd was wearing a seat belt when he was shot. Burleson is white. The suit alleges that the officers' actions were ""willful and malicious"" and that they acted ""willfully and knowingly"" to ""inflict emotional distress upon Mr. Floyd."" ""These officers' actions were calculated to cause and prolong the suffering of Mr. Floyd's family and to deprive them of a fair trial,"" Burleson's attorney, John Morgan, said in a statement. The officers involved in the shooting of Floyd, who have not been identified, have been placed on administrative leave, the South Florida Police Department said. """,541
2,https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/22/us/black-lives-matter-support-declines-trnd/index.html," Public support for the Black Lives Matter movement has dropped since June, report finds"," But that support has declined since early June, just days after the Black father died after a Minneapolis officer knelt on his neck for more than seven minutes, a new report finds. A majority of adults -- 55% -- said this month that they support the movement, but it's a notable drop from the 67% who said the same between June 4 and 10, the report by the Pew Research Center shows. Among respondents who say they strongly support the movement, the numbers dipped to 29% between September 8 and 13 from 38% about three months prior. The Black Lives Matter movement began in 2013 as a hashtag in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman for the killing of Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old Black boy. Since then, it has become a global rallying cry aiming to spread the message about police brutality, though it has been criticized for its some of its demands and methods.  Since Floyd's death, other examples of police violence against Black people have grabbed headlines, including the cases of Jacob Blake and Daniel Prude. And confrontations have escalated between protesters and law enforcement officials in US cities, most notably in Portland, Oregon. which saw over 100 days of unrest. Racial and partisan divides The share of Black adults who said this month that they support the Black Lives Matter movement -- 87% -- has ticked up 1 percentage point since June, the Pew results show.  But this pattern does not hold true among Whites and Hispanic adults. In fact, support for the movement has significantly dwindled among those two groups in the past three months.  In June, 60% of White adults said they strongly or somewhat supported the Black Lives Matter movement. This month, 45% of White adults expressed the same sentiments. Among Hispanic adults, support in those categories dropped from 77% to 66%. The political divides among supporters of the movement has also widened, the report shows. Among respondents identifying as White Republican and White Republican leaners, 16% supported the movement in September -- a sharp decline from 37% in June. However, the change is not as significant for White Democrats and White Democratic leaners, with 88% expressing support for the movement this month compared with 92% three months ago. Additionally, while ""half of White Democrats (51%) say they strongly support the movement, just 2% of White Republicans say the same,"" according to Pew. "," Public support for the Black Lives Matter movement has dropped since June, report finds. Meanwhile, the number of Black Americans who say the police are doing a good job has increased from 35% in June 2016 to 49% in a new CNN/ORC poll. It's a change that's been driven in part by increased support for Black Lives Matter. ""It's not surprising that the black community is seeing more positive messages from the media and politicians about police officers,"" said Randal O'Toole, a professor of African-American studies at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. ""The public's response to the unrest in Ferguson has been to push for more police involvement in the community and to demand justice for those killed by police.""
 The city's police chief said the decision to fire Wilson was ""not the right decision"" and that he would ""look at all options to resolve this matter."" ""Our officers have done what they have to protect themselves and their communities, and I believe the actions of our police officers were appropriate and consistent with our commitment to the safety of our citizens,"" Police Chief Gary W. Wilson said in a statement. ""I am confident that we can all agree that there are things we all can agree on -- that our community can agree on -- and that is that there must be a full investigation of this incident."" The Ferguson Police Department has been under fire since the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown in August of 2014, and the resulting protests and national attention have brought racial tensions to the fore. Protesters have called for justice in the killing of Brown and for the formation of a police oversight board to oversee the department. ""The Black Lives Matter movement has had a great impact on the conversation and change in Ferguson,"" said James E. O'Neill Jr., a political science professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. ""The Black Lives Matter protests have brought about a lot of change in how we see the police department, but what's missing is the critical component that Ferguson needs -- the police officer.""

3,https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/14/us/iyw-childrens-books-black-characters-nonprofit-trnd/index.html," Black lives matter in children's books, too. That's why this couple started a non-profit "," The attorney, who's an avid reader, went online instead and found a couple of books with Black characters. She bought them for her niece -- and donated some more to local community centers.   ""I became frustrated and decided I wanted to do something about it,"" Roseman told CNN of the dearth of Black title characters in children's literature.  She told her future husband about her experience. ""He had a bigger vision for what we can do,"" the 36-year-old said. The couple filed paperwork to start a non-profit. Six weeks later, Young, Black & Lit was born. Making an impact, one child at a time  Young, Black & Lit provides free books that feature Black main characters to children. The organization has distributed more than 5,000 books in the Chicagoland area through book fairs, community groups and schools.  ""When a child sees themselves reflected in the books that they read, when the books are a mirror to them, they feel valued,"" said Roseman. Eleven percent of children's books had Black main characters last year, according to the Cooperative Children's Book Center at the School of Education, University of Wisconsin-Madison. Representation has been growing: In 2015, just 7% of books featured Black characters.  For Roseman, a bigger problem is this: 60% of students in low-income communities don't have any books at all in their homes.  ""That speaks to a lack of libraries, a lack of books within libraries, also money within the community to support buying books,"" she said. A Department of Education study backs that up. It found 2.5 million children are enrolled in school districts where there are no libraries at all -- a huge problem since, the report finds, students who have books in their homes perform better academically.  ""It's not only about seeing yourself in the books that you read, but being able to take a peek into the world of other children, who look different than you and experience life different than you,"" Roseman said. 8-year-old thinks he is Superman  Amir Wilson's parents tried to find books with Black characters before the non-profit came along, but ""it was just always a challenge finding the ones for his age,"" said his father, Kareem Wilson. Amir's third grade class received books from Young, Black & Lit last school year.  ""(The non-profit) made me keenly aware that there were books out there like this,"" Wilson said. ""I had no idea.""  The 8-year-old said he loved reading ""Hidden Figures"" about the Black women and NASA mathematicians who helped the US win the space race.   ""Other people say they can't do stuff, and they prove them wrong,"" Amir told CNN. But his favorite genre is superheroes, so bringing home ""Miles Morales: Spider-Man"" was thrilling.   ""It's the best Spider-Man ever,"" the young reader told CNN.  ""He thinks he's Spider-Man,"" added Amir's dad. ""To have Black characters gives a sense of pride in who one is.""  How Covid-19 changed their plans Before the pandemic, Roseman and her husband would go to schools, community events and businesses and set up tables filled with more than a hundred books with Black characters on the covers.  Children and their parents would wander up and take books they liked for free.  ""We hear them say, 'Hey, that girl looks like me,' or 'Her hair is like mine,' and that's really an affirmation of the work that we're doing -- that they're excited to see such an array of books of children who look like them, who share those stories, share their family dynamics,"" said Roseman.  The book titles would make anyone excited -- from the illustrated book about the late Rep. John Lewis, ""Preaching to the Chickens,"" to stories about haircuts like ""Crown.""  ""This talks about the everyday story of a boy getting his haircut in the barbershop, and the joy that he feels,"" said Derrick Ramsey, Roseman's husband. ""If you think about when you get your hair done, you feel better afterwards, right? It's about the pride that you feel once you have a haircut.""  When the pandemic hit in March, the book fairs stopped and schools and libraries shut down. The couple sent books directly to students' homes.  This year, they will launch a program giving every low-income student in kindergarten one book per month during the school year, then five books during the summer throughout schools in Evanston, Illinois, just north of Chicago. The giving continues through the third grade, a pivotal grade when focus shifts from learning to read to reading to learn, Roseman said. Creating a library of books with Black characters  When they started out, Ramsey and Roseman faced an uphill battle finding books to buy with Black characters through publisher websites because, Ramsey said, there was no way to sort children's books this way.  ""You would think that the work of finding these books would be simple, right? That I can go to a publisher's website and I can click, 'Give me the African American books,' and they would all come out in a list and we could just download,"" Ramsey told CNN. Instead, they went through thousands of books on each publisher's website, he said. Now that the couple has collated everything and reached out to publishers, it's become a lot easier to add new titles.  They first purchased books with support from their network of friends and associates, said Ramsey. ""We started out with a very cut-and-dry budget.""  Now, grants and individual donations are helping their mission. Those who can afford it can buy books directly from their website for their own families -- with all the money going directly to fund free books for children.    ""I've loved books ever since I was a kid. They were expanding my imagination,"" said Roseman. ""I could always be caught with a book. And so Young, Black & Lit was one way for me to pursue that passion and help children along the way."" Roseman and Ramsey got engaged while running this non-profit. Both said the work helped show they were meant to be together.  ""I think that was a crash course and a preview into what we hope will be a very successful marriage because we were able to really communicate and execute a vision together,"" said Roseman.  ""A crash course in team work, conflict management, listening -- all key things you have to have in a successful relationship,"" said Ramsey as his wife laughed."," Black lives matter in children's books, too. That's why this couple started a non-profit  that raises awareness and funds for positive social change.  They wanted to create something that would reach out to the real people who they see as part of the problem, but also be accessible to everyone.  ""I think that it's really important that we continue to do this work because it will help us make a difference in the world,""  Kaitlin said.  ""We're trying to make a difference in the world and make a difference in people's lives. It's very empowering to see the world through the eyes of other people. It's very powerful.""  If you want to support the work they're doing, you can donate here.
 When we think about the history of race relations in this country, we often think of the 18th and 19th centuries. The ""Bloody Sunday"" clashes between whites and black Americans were a defining moment in American history. But there's another moment that we often ignore: the 1960s. And that's when the Civil Rights movement began. The 1960s were a pivotal moment in the history of race relations in the United States. It was the beginning of the Black Lives Matter movement and the beginning of the era of ""law and order"" politics that we're still seeing today. So what happened in the 1960s is a topic for historians, sociologists and activists to discuss. But to talk about it in depth, it helps to look at the broader context in which it happened. So let's start with an overview of the Civil Rights Movement in the US. The '60s and '70s The Civil Rights Movement started in the summer of 1964 with the assassination of four civil rights workers, and it snowballed into a nationwide movement. In the early days, it was mainly young people coming out to protest the Vietnam War and the assassinations of civil rights workers like MLK Jr. But as the movement grew, so did the numbers of people involved. By the mid-1970s, the number of protesters had more than doubled to more than 8 million people. The movement gained momentum when police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds in the city of Selma, Alabama. A year later, police killed 36 people, most of them black residents of Selma. In the late '70s and early '80s, protests were also seen in cities like Minneapolis and New York City. But the focus shifted to other issues, such as police brutality and the decline of the civil rights movement. By the mid-1990s, the number of protests had more than doubled to more than 50 million people. But it wasn't until 2009, when protests surpassed 50 million people. The surge in protests coincided with the Black Lives Matter movement. The movement became a major topic of conversation and discussion turned to the meaning of blackness. Some say the focus on blackness and social justice is a direct result of the protests, but others say the Black Lives Matter movement has contributed to the decline of the civil rights movement. How many protests was it during the 1960s? The numbers may be hard to come by, but the New York Times estimates there were between 10.4 and 20 million protests during the 1960s and early 1970s. In the 1980s, the numbers were closer to 20 million protests. The numbers have been declining since the mid-2000s. The numbers peaked in the early 1980s and have declined ever since. In the 1960s, there were some of the most significant protests in American history, such as the sit-ins at the University of Missouri-St. Louis and the Million Man March. But protests have been largely forgotten these days. In the 1970s, protests were overshadowed by the Black Power movement, but it wasn't until the 1980s that the movement gained traction. In the 1990s and 2000s, protests became a major topic of conversation and discussion turned to the meaning of blackness and social justice.  But the protests of the 1960s and 1970s have largely been forgotten.  In the 1980s and 1990s, protests were largely about economic issues, such as the Vietnam War and the rise of Black Lives Matter. But the movement has also drawn attention to issues of race, gender and social justice. How many protests was it during the 1960s? It depends on who you ask.  The New York Times estimates there were between 3.8 and 10.9 million protests during the 1960s and 1970s. But the numbers have declined since then. In the 1980s and 1990s, the numbers were closer to 4.8 million. In the 2000s, the numbers were closer to 5.2 million.  So it's not surprising that the number of protests during the 1960s is dwarfed by the number in the present day. What are the implications? This is why the Civil Rights Movement has been called the most important civil rights movement in US history. It was a watershed moment in American history",1023
4,https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/18/us/blm-protests-small-town-ohio-trnd/index.html, A White police chief lays out why Black Lives Matter protests matter in small towns," Doug Swartz, Canal Fulton's police chief of eight years, writes a column for a community newsletter quarterly tackling a variety of topics. This month, he focused on the Black Lives Matter movement after seeing several people on his social media feeds asking why it was necessary to demonstrate, especially in the small town of Canal Fulton with a population just under 5,500. Canal Fulton is about 50 miles south of Cleveland.  Thousands have demonstrated in communities across the world to protest and demand racial justice in the aftermath of George Floyd's death. The 46-year-old Black man died May 25 at the hands of Minneapolis police with his last moments caught on video. About 93% of racial justice protests in the US since Floyd's death have been peaceful and nondestructive, according to a new report. Swartz's commentary gained traction outside of the newsletter and a condensed version was published in the local paper, The Canton Repository.  ""If we truly seek fulfillment in our lives, the White community also needs the Black community just as much, if not more,"" Swartz wrote. ""Our continuously intersecting lives will always be contentious if we don't stop and take time to actively listen to one another and understand."" Bridging the gap between races  A few residents tried to organize protests in Canal Fulton, according to Swartz, but due to lack of manpower and the coronavirus pandemic, the demonstrations never materialized. After her grandson made a Facebook post about why Black lives matter, Roslyn Haines, a Black minister in town, told CNN she was inspired and wanted to do something. Haines and a few other residents came together to form the group ""Bridging The Gap.""  ""It's to bridge the gap of all races, all groups so that there is total peace and no misunderstandings,"" she said. ""Along with the violence, the racism, has to stop.""  Haines grew up in Akron but relocated to Canal Fulton a few years ago and said she's never experienced racism directly, but like anywhere, she said she knows it's out there. ""It's a good community to live in and I'm glad that I live out here, I just want to see people come together,"" she said. ""And if it spreads here in Canal Fulton, it can spread across the United States."" Even though ""Bridging The Gap"" had to push pause on their efforts, Haines said the group is in the planning stages for another rally next year. ""If a small city like Canal Fulton can come together as one, then other cities will see that and from there it would be like a domino effect,"" she said. ""Sometimes we have to start small in order to get really big.""  Fixing the 'atrocities that occurred just a few short decades ago' To understand why peaceful protests are important, particularly in small towns, Swartz said it's vital to understand the role American history played. Though the United States declared its independence on July 4, 1776, Swartz wrote he personally feels the country wasn't a ""free nation"" until the 13th Amendment in 1865, which abolished slavery. But even then, he said, ""was the African American race truly a free race after that day? Free of racism and discrimination?""  Because Canal Fulton is predominantly White, Swartz said the community is blind to the struggles of their Black neighbors.  ""How do you know about it, if you don't know about it,"" he said. ""If there are struggles that are going on in predominately Black neighborhoods, we don't know about it, our kids go to schools that are predominately White. And we're a byproduct of that history with the things that are wrong in today's society, that's why we have to listen to people and hear from them to see how we can make things better."" Swartz said ultimately, it's the responsibility of all communities, big or small, to ""move resources to help fix today the aftermath of the atrocities that occurred just a few short decades ago.""  ""In summary, African Americans had little family, religion, education, or wealth to go with their newly found freedoms nor to rectify the generations of wrongs they received,"" Swartz wrote. ""They were in no position to stop what was coming next, which was a century long of practices of discrimination, racism, segregation, and manipulating African Americans of being inferior to the White supremacy."" ""Everyone on this earth older than 56 years of age, lived in a time when African Americans were barred from using bathrooms that were labeled, 'Whites Only.' What message do you think that sent our parents and grandparents? That message was that of Blacks being less of a person than that a White person."" Able to grow by listening to the struggles of marginalized communities  ""I'm starting to understand this message is bigger than I intended it to be,"" Swartz said. ""I'm struggling though to understand why it is getting so much attention when you can find all this information on the internet, but I guess it's coming from the position of a small town police chief in America.""  The positive emails and feedback have continued to pour in since the article published, he said. Swartz admits in his younger years he may have said or thought differently, but because he dove deeper into history and listened to the struggles of marginalized communities, he was able to grow and write this commentary piece. ""To do this, African Americans are going to need the vast majority of support (votes) to help enact legislation which will help move critical resources and funding into areas such as our education and housing systems,"" he wrote. ""That means you and me here in Canal Fulton. That means protesting in little towns to help bring awareness to these issues that are still in the shadows of the discriminatory practices occurring in the 60s. That means our citizens helping to understand what African Americans in other communities are currently struggling with as it will be our vote and support that helps.""  ""It begins by active listening and the understanding of our long-term goals, even well past our own lives, as well as history's misdeeds,"" he wrote. ""Recognizing the rights of everyone including the right to peacefully protest, wherever and whenever, is a key element of fostering change for any good cause."" Swartz said even though past protests didn't materialize, he would gladly welcome any future peaceful demonstrations within the community and support residents in their efforts. ""No matter what the cause is, we have to be able to say 'that's great, that's the American way,' that's what you're allowed to do and anyone who is trying to stop someone from practicing their constitutional rights needs to stop and think about what they're actually doing,"" he said."," A White police chief lays out why Black Lives Matter protests matter in small towns and urban areas of the US. Here's what you need to know. What's at stake? The White House and the Capitol Hill are both controlled by Republicans. So is the White House. If the White House and the Capitol Hill vote to defund Planned Parenthood, the fallout could be even more dire for Republicans in Congress. The White House could lose the power to defund Planned Parenthood, a move that would effectively end federal funding for the group. This could lead to a government shutdown and possibly even a government default. What happens next? The White House says it will call up the American Health Care Act, a Republican-led bill that would dismantle the Affordable Care Act. The bill would replace the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate with a ""public option"" that would encourage people to get coverage. But the AHCA faces some hurdles in the Senate, where Democrats are united in opposition. Republicans plan to hold a vote next week on a budget resolution that would keep the government open through September.
 The gunman killed five officers and wounded eight others Thursday night at a Dallas protest over the police killing of Philando Castile, a black man. What happened next was seen from several miles away. Police said the gunman was ""disturbed"" by the violence and decided to go back to his apartment. But a neighbor who said she saw the suspect in the apartment said he didn't seem upset. ""He just stood there, he was upset,"" the woman said. ""He walked out the front door and he didn't come back inside."" A woman who lives near the scene of the shooting told CNN that the man's apartment had been broken into and that the man had been there for a few days.

""After various attempts to meet with you in person concerning a protest you planned to hold in the Borough, we were alerted to your July 25 protests just three days before it took place,"" Kranjac told Gil, according to a copy of the letter shared with CNN. In an email to CNN Saturday, Kranjac said the bill was rescinded. In a separate correspondence provided to CNN, Kranjac also told Gil it would be rescinded, pending approval by the city council. ""The bill for police overtime that you were provided was issued pursuant to the advice I received from our Borough Administrator who I understand consulted the Borough Attorney,"" Kranjac wrote. ""I have researched the issue further with my own counsel and I am hereby rescinding the bill, subject to our Council's ratification of my action."" Kranjac did not respond to additional requests for comment. The rally drew about 30-40 people, organizer says Gil first asked about the rules regarding protests weeks ahead of July 25, according to emails she shared. When city officials asked to meet in person about her planned protest, she offered instead to discuss it via Zoom or email because of the coronavirus pandemic. However, the borough's clerk and mayor continued to push for an in-person meeting, according to the email correspondences shared with CNN. Gil said she organized the rally to highlight the small number of residents of color in Englewood Cliffs, and how her town's lack of affordable housing disproportionately affects people of color, particularly black and Native American people. Englewood Cliffs is about 1.4% Black, compared to 15.1% statewide, according to the US Census Bureau. About 30 to 40 people showed up at the rally outside of the town's administrative building, Gil said. After an initial police presence before the rally, officers went indoors, only coming out temporarily to move plastic barricades, Gil said. Englewood Cliffs Police Chief William Henkelman did not respond to CNN's requests for comment. Mayor says ordinances have to be adjusted Amol Sinha, executive director of the ACLU of New Jersey, said the bill was ""clearly unconstitutional."" ""You cannot require protesters to foot the bill for protected First Amendment activity,"" Sinha told CNN. Englewood Cliffs City Council President Gloria Oh said that Kranjac acted ""unilaterally"" in billing Gil, adding that normally the council would vote on a resolution before an individual would be charged for police service, which would not apply in the case of a protest or any other gatherings protected under the First Amendment. Prior to the mayor's rescinding of the bill, Oh and three fellow Democratic council members said in a statement that they were ""unequivocally opposed"" to the decision to bill Gil and would seek to cancel it. Kranjac told Gil in an email that she provided to CNN that he always wants ""to make certain that everyone's Constitutional Rights are fully respected"" and that they ""will have to adjust the Borough's ordinances accordingly. ""I was glad that you were able to express your rights to freedom of speech and assembly,"" Kranjac wrote. Gil told CNN the experience made her realize ""that there's a lot more work to do."" ""If anything, it's made me realize that there are a lot of people in power that have abused that power,"" Gil said. ""We need to change that and make ourselves more welcoming, and more accommodating. It cannot be like this. It's unacceptable."""," A New Jersey teen was billed $2,500 in police overtime for a Black Lives Matter protest, but his wallet was taken before he could get his money.
 The protesters' demands include the creation of a central database of police shootings, the reinstatement of the ""stand your ground"" law and the protection of the right to protest. The decision to call off the protests came after intense negotiations with police and city officials, the New York Times reported. The city and the NYPD initially said they would not issue permits to protest, but the city and the NYPD announced Wednesday that they will be issuing permits later this week. ""I am pleased that our community is once again engaged in peaceful protest and we are making progress toward a just and lasting solution to the systemic racism that has plagued our city for decades,"" NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill said. ""The NYPD and City Council are working together to make sure that peaceful protest is not compromised by the actions of a few.""

We will not allow it to be used to intimidate our community and we will not allow it to be used to profit from the oppression of our community."" The NYPD and Mayor Bill de Blasio have not said what they will do next. The protests began last weekend, when the city council voted to ban chokeholds in the city. Mayor Bill de Blasio told CNN that the NYPD is still reviewing the council's vote. The ban was later overturned by the city's Board of Police Commissioners.

 After a grand jury in Baltimore failed to indict a white police officer in the death of Freddie Gray, the nation's attention turned to the case of an African-American police officer, Darren Toms, who was killed in a high-speed police chase. But for the first time since Gray's death, the nation saw two videos from the same vantage point. The first video showed the aftermath of Gray's arrest and the second video, which was recorded by his wife, showed the aftermath of the arrest. The video captured the moment when a police officer pulled Gray over for allegedly failing to use his turn signal. He was then run over by a police officer. Gray died on April 12, the day after he was arrested. Here are some other developments in the case of the two police officers involved in Gray's death. Protests over the deaths of Gray and other African-Americans have spurred protests across the nation, with more than 200 demonstrations in more than 30 cities.

8,https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/31/us/blm-sign-kkk-headquarters-trnd/index.html," A White filmmaker held up a Black Lives Matter sign in Harrison, Arkansas, and here's what happened"," With a GoPro strapped to his chest under his shirt, out of view to his subjects, and a lapel mic on his body, Rob Bliss, 31, stood on the side of the road in Harrison, Arkansas, with his handmade poster. Harrison is 135 miles north of the capital Little Rock.  ""They say light is always the best disinfectant, and by showing the reality of many of these places it helps expose people who are in these big cities that don't really know what is still going on in the United States today,"" he told CNN.  Bliss, a content creator from Los Angeles, is known for producing viral video campaigns on social issues. In 2014, he worked on a project showcasing what 10 hours of street harassment in New York City looked like for women, which was criticized at the time for only featuring minorities and little to no White individuals. In 2013, Bliss created a fundraising video featuring a homeless veteran receiving a makeover.  In his latest project, Bliss said he strung together an edited video compilation of what he believes is a raw look and reminder of just how prevalent racism remains in pockets of the country.  ""There is a fair amount of preaching to the choir in liberal spaces,"" Bliss said. That's why he decided to travel to Harrison -- a town ""known for its struggle with race and White pride billboards,"" he said. That, coupled with the fact that it is just outside of the home to the national headquarters of the KKK.  ""I know that I have privileges and abilities as a White man to go into a nearly all White town and hold this sign without as much fear as a person of color would have,"" he said. ""I think it's important where I have these privileges, I have a responsibility to use them to help lift up other people as well."" According to the Southern Poverty Law Center and the KKK, Harrison is home to the national chapter of the group. Harrison Regional Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Bob Largent told CNN the organization is actually headquartered in Zinc, Arkansas, 15 miles east of Harrison.  Three days of hearing from residents  The two minute video was posted on Monday and begins with Bliss holding his sign in front of a billboard on the side of a busy highway in Harrison. It says ""For the Family"" with a picture of what appears to be a family and a cross next to it, with the websites WhitePrideRadio.com and AltRightTV.com across the top and bottom of the board. ""I think most people in passing didn't realize that they were being recorded,"" Bliss said. ""But this is all happening in a wide open, public space with no expectations of privacy as you can see in the video.""  Throughout the video compilation of edited clips by Bliss, he captures residents driving past him and, at some points, walking by him, to express their animosity toward his presence. Bliss filmed over the course of three days the first week of July. In the clips seen on his video, Bliss said he stood on the side of a main highway for parts of the video. ""Have a little pride in your race brother,"" a man in a gray minivan says in the video while driving by Bliss. ""White pride worldwide.""  In the video, another man in a tan car drives by Bliss, shows him his middle finger and says nothing at first. He then returns a second time to say, ""About ten minutes I'm gonna be back, you better be f****** gone."" Bliss said that man didn't return.  One person after another can be seen in the video berating Bliss for the message on his sign, some questioning his beliefs by asking if he's a Marxist, Communist or domestic terrorist.  ""Hey all lives matter, not just Black,"" another man from a black SUV yells to Bliss. ""You're a Caucasian.""   But the video wasn't entirely negative. At the end of the video, Bliss featured one clip of a woman handing him a handwritten note. Bliss said he blurred her face in the video for her protection. ""Ignore the haters you're being peaceful,"" the note read. ""What you're doing is good. Just a friendly reminder. Don't give up hope.""  While Bliss was filming with his sign, he estimates about a dozen people took the time to offer him something to drink while he was standing in the heat. Clips of those interactions were not shown in his video. ""Much like how I didn't include every negative thing said to me because the video was a summary, I didn't include the people who gave me Gatorade because I wanted to save that positive sentiment for the girl who gave me the note,"" he said. ""I think she symbolized that sentiment the best.""  City leaders say the video doesn't reflect their community Bliss' video caught the attention of Harrison city leaders. Boone County Judge Robert Hathaway, Harrison Mayor Jerry Jackson and Chamber of Commerce President Largent issued a joint online statement Tuesday to denounce the behavior of the locals featured in the video. ""The video does not represent Boone County nor the City of Harrison,"" the statement said. ""While we cannot excuse the reprehensible behavior and words of individuals recorded in the video, we know for certain that they do not reflect the views of the majority of the good people of our communities."" On Friday, Largent told CNN he continues to work with community, elected and business leaders along with a task force on race relations, a group that was formed in 2003 by Bob Reynolds who was mayor at the time. The task force is made up of local clergy and volunteers, according to the City of Harrison's website. ""It is obvious there is still work to be done in our area and across the nation,"" the city leaders' statement said. ""We must constantly strive to do better, and we pledge our continued efforts in that regard."" The task force was created at a time when racial tensions in the area were high, group member Kevin Cheri told CNN. He joined their efforts in 2013. Cheri, a Black man, said the purpose of the group is to ""address issues relative to this perception of Harrison as this racist community.""  Since its inception, Cheri said the group has made significant strides to change the perception of Harrison by ""facilitating resolutions to community issues through programs and conversations,"" according to Cheri. He called Bliss' video a ""mixed blessing.""  ""What it has done for us is, it's helped the few people who are still in denial see that there are a few people here with that mentality,"" Cheri said. ""But not to the degree in the way that it implies by the way that  (Bliss) presented it.""  Correction: Prior versions of this story misspelled Kevin Cheri's last name. "," A White filmmaker held up a Black Lives Matter sign in Harrison, Arkansas, and here's what happened next. 'It's not about the flag' The controversial statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee was vandalized with graffiti, and a Black Lives Matter protester was arrested. A local resident called the police to report the vandalism. Police said they found a photo of the statue online and arrested the person who posted the photo. ""The vandalism was done in the name of a political movement, not a hate crime,"" Harrison Police Chief Todd W. Anderson said. ""It's not about the flag. It's about the people who were targeted because of the color of their skin. This is about the people who were targeted because of the actions of a few."" The vandalism came after a rally for Black Lives Matter. Demonstrators waved a banner and chanted ""No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA"" outside the statue's location. The event was peaceful. CNN affiliate WMC said the demonstrators were there to protest ""racist and anti-Semitic policies"" in the country.

But it was the first time in his life he felt fear for the first time, he said. ""I was scared for my life. I was afraid for his life,"" he said. ""I was afraid for his life and my safety. I was scared for my family and my kids."" The young man is 15-year-old Dakin Armstrong, who was shot by an officer in the head after he ran away from police in the early morning hours of April 17. Armstrong's death was ruled a homicide by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office, but the grand jury didn't indict the officer. He was not armed when he was shot. ""I don't have a weapon of any kind, but I have a gun,"" Armstrong said. ""I have a permit to carry it."" Armstrong said he was in a school bathroom at the time of the shooting. ""I didn't have any idea that it was going to happen like it did. I was just thinking about my kids. I was worried about them, and I'm just glad that it's over."" Armstrong's family has said they want answers. ""I'm hoping that this can be a wake-up call to those around us who are scared and afraid of our police force and the government,"" his mother, Lucien Armstrong, said. ""I'm hoping that the people who have guns can feel safe and protected and then we can start moving on with our lives.""

The call, however, appears to have been a swatting and is under investigation, the spokesperson said.  Swatting is a dangerous prank call made to authorities with the express purpose of luring them to a location where they are led to believe a horrific crime has been committed or is in progress. Abdullah, the co-founder of Black Lives Matter Los Angeles and a Cal State L.A. professor, streamed live video on her Instagram account Wednesday morning showing heavily armed officers assembled outside her home.  ""We were called to this location that there is a male in there holding you guys hostage and he wants $1 million or he's going to kill you within an hour,"" an officer standing outside her home could be heard saying on the video. ""We just want to make sure you're OK."" ""I'm fine. My kids are petrified,"" Abdullah responded. Later, the video was no longer available on her account. Abdullah said after the incident she doesn't believe that police actually received a 911 call reporting a kidnapping at her home, calling the claim ""cockamamie."" ""My house was surrounded by LAPD this morning. We had assault rifles drawn on me and my three children and they came up with some cockamamie story about, they got a call that the people in this residence are being held hostage. We know that's not true,"" Abdullah said at a previously planned news conference at Cal State L.A. ""We don't even believe they got that call. We believe it's yet another tactic that's being used to block us from ushering in black freedom.""  Abdullah did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment. Los Angeles City Council President Herb Wesson Jr. called for an investigation into what he said appeared to be a swatting incident.

The two women were killed by police in separate incidents that night. Floyd died at a hospital shortly after midnight Sunday, while Taylor was shot shortly after midnight Sunday. Authorities said Floyd died of a gunshot wound to the head. Authorities said they don't know what happened between the two women. Floyd's death was captured on cellphone video. The videos were released in the wake of Floyd's death and protests over the case. The protests grew to become a national movement. In an emotional press conference, Floyd's brother said the family is ""heartbroken"" and ""disappointed."" ""I just want to tell you that we will be here all the way to the end of this trial,"" Floyd said. ""You are going to see us again, you are going to see us again.

Court records show that Rogers still faces three felony counts for attempted malicious wounding -- one count for each of the three people injured in the incident. None of the injuries were life-threatening, Henrico County Commonwealth's Attorney Shannon Taylor said.  Rogers has not yet entered a plea to the felony charges, and his attorney has not responded to CNN's multiple requests for comment.  Several witnesses at the June 7th Black Lives Matter protest in Henrico County, Virginia, reported that a vehicle had ""revved their engine and drove through the protesters occupying the roadway,"" Henrico County Police said. Rogers was arrested, and a victim who had called to report the incident was checked by rescue workers at the scene and refused further treatment, according to police. The incident drew parallels to the 2017 rally in Charlottesville, during which 32-year-old Heather Heyer was killed when a car plowed into a crowd of counterprotesters gathered to oppose a ""Unite the Right"" rally of White nationalist and other right-wing groups.  Taylor said in a statement in June that the ""egregious criminal act will not go unpunished."" ""We lived through this in Virginia in Charlottesville in 2017,"" Taylor said. ""Hate has no place here under my watch."" Prosecutors say Rogers had KKK paraphernalia in his truck and home Rogers is described by prosecutors as ""an admitted leader of the Ku Klux Klan and a propagandist for Confederate ideology.""  Police officers who arrested Rogers searched his truck and home and found multiple weapons and clips of ammunition, several KKK and Confederate flag patches and Klan literature in the car's glove compartment, according to Taylor. She added that one of the patches was for a local KKK chapter that Rogers admitted to being the leader of.   Taylor also said that Rogers broadcasted live on Facebook at least twice on June 7. She said one video was thought to be filmed on his way to the protest, telling his friends to join him. Another video was believed to be filmed after he had driven his car into protesters, ""regaling in how he revved the engine and drove right on through,"" Taylor said.   Rogers was not charged with a hate crime Rogers was ultimately not charged with any hate crimes, despite prosecutors seeking to add hate crime sentencing enhancements to his charges.  A judge rejected the hate crime enhancements to the assault charges, ruling that the three White victims were not targeted because of their race. But Rogers was still sentenced to the maximum amount of time for each of the charges.  Taylor believes that current Virginia law regarding hate crimes is ""insufficient,"" and that a new law is needed for crimes ""when one acts with hatred against a group of people supporting each other,"" irrespective of the victim's race or ethnicity.  ""Our current law recognizes the ethnicity of the victim as a basis for our hate crime, but our current laws are insufficient; we need a law that will capture the hateful and vengeful intent of a defendant regardless of the skin color of the victim,"" Taylor said. ""A devout member of the KKK, whose ideology believes that people of color are inferior, does not believe in the Black Lives Matter movement. Any action towards a Black Lives Matter movement is one based in hate and that should be a reason to impose a harsher sentence."" The hearing for Rogers on his remaining felony charges is scheduled for September 14. "," An 'admitted leader of the KKK' is sentenced to 6 years in prison for driving his truck through Black Lives Matter protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia.

The former police officer who killed Heather Heyer, a 32-year-old paralegal who was marching peacefully in Charlottesville, has been sentenced to life in prison.

George Floyd, a 45-year-old black man, was sentenced to life in prison on Friday for first-degree murder and five counts of malicious wounding, the maximum sentence for both crimes. Floyd's sentence was the first of the five men charged in the attack on Saturday night. Floyd, who was unarmed, was killed when a car plowed into a group of people protesting against the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville. Floyd was carrying a permit to protest the planned rally, which was organized by the far-right ""Unite the Right"" group. Police said they saw a car speeding away from the group. The attack started when Floyd was hit with a car door, and then the gunfire erupted. Five men were charged in his death. The five men face charges including first-degree murder, malicious wounding and felonious assault. The attack on Floyd began when a car drove into a group of demonstrators, killing Heather Heyer, 32, and injuring 19 others.
 The mayor of Charlottesville has issued a statement saying the city will not condemn the white nationalists and ""white supremacists"" who have descended on the city. ""I condemn this act of violence in the strongest possible terms,"" Mayor Mike Signer said. ""We will not stand by and watch our city or our citizens suffer. The violence of the last night has only served to highlight the fact that the city of Charlottesville, and our nation, still has much more to offer than a political football match."" Signer said the city will not stand by and watch its citizens suffer ""because of this man's actions."" ""I am reminded that our city's history is full of examples of peaceful protest and reflection. But this attack, in which the masked shooter stood proudly in the street, brandishing weapons of violence, only to be confronted with bullets in the street and the life of a young man, is an attack on all of us,"" Signer said.
 In an emotional press conference Monday, FBI Director James Comey and the acting director of the bureau's Richmond field office, Michael Steinbach, said they did not find any evidence to support the claim that the men responsible for Saturday's violence were inspired by the groups that descended on the city last weekend. But they did say that they were troubled by the evidence collected from witnesses and investigators. ""It's not enough to say that we don't have a motive,"" Comey said. ""We have not found one. We have not found one that satisfies our description."" ""And it certainly doesn't mean that we don't have one. We don't have one,"" he added. The FBI has already interviewed witnesses and collected evidence. The US attorney's office in the Eastern District of Virginia is investigating the attack. ""We have found that there was no nexus between the actions of the white nationalists and those opposed to them on",610

Other themes, like the importance of voting and Black pride, were painted as well.  But on Sunday morning, the community woke up to see that each letter had been vandalized with splatters of white and gray paint.  ""It's just awful,"" Rebecca Robinson, the artist who painted the ""L"" in ""Black"" said in a Facebook Live video as she showed the defaced mural. ""It's just so disappointing because everybody worked so hard.""  The Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department told CNN affiliate WRTV that it is investigating the vandalism, but did not provide any further details. The department did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.  Indy10 Black Lives Matter, one of the groups that helped organize the mural, said the incident didn't dampen its fight for Black lives.  ""Just as our parents, elders, and ancestors persisted among burning crosses on their front lawns, so shall we,"" the group said in a Facebook post Sunday. ""YOU can't stop the revolution. We are still here. It is rising up in all of us. Paint can't stop that.""  When asked for further comment, the group referred CNN to its statement on Facebook. Murals supporting the movement for social justice have popped up across the US since the widespread protests sparked by George Floyd's death.  The Indianapolis mural, located on Indiana Avenue, is just the latest Black Lives Matter art display to have been vandalized.  The mural outside Trump Tower in midtown Manhattan was vandalized at least four times since it was created in early July. Other Black Lives Matter murals in Washington, Vermont, California were also vandalized. "," Just one week after it was painted, a Black Lives Matter mural in Indianapolis was vandalized  by a man who said, ""I'm sorry."" The mural, which was painted by an artist who is black, was spray-painted over by someone who wanted to make a statement about police violence and oppression. The man was also angry about the Black Lives Matter flag being displayed in the window of a Starbucks. ""I'm sorry. I'm sorry,"" the man said in a video posted on the Twitter account of the artist. ""I'm really sorry. I'm just very confused."" The man also said he was angry about the fact that the flag had been taken down. ""I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry,"" he said. ""I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.""  The man's video quickly went viral. It showed a man in a dark suit and a white shirt standing near a sign with the words ""Black Lives Matter."" A woman in a light dress and a black skirt walked over to the man and said, ""I'm sorry,"" and then walked away.  The man then posted a video of the incident on Facebook. ""I just wanted to apologize,"" the man said in the video. ""I'm really sorry. I was angry about something else. I was trying to do something good. I want to apologize for that. I'm sorry."" In an interview with CNN, the man said that he doesn't feel safe in the city. ""I don't feel safe here",295

""I was shocked that someone could be purposefully doing this. It hurt a lot, it made me extremely upset."" Following three days of what she called ""overwhelming frustration,"" Sharick wrote the message in direct view of her security camera.  That's when she saw a man she says she never met and only knows as Jim, pouring water over the message. In a video Sharick recorded on her phone after running out to confront him, the man tells her that he will continue to remove the word ""as long as she keeps on doing this."" ""I was only pouring across the word Black because I believe that all lives matter,"" Jim told CNN affiliate KGO. ""I don't care what nationality, sexual orientation or any of that, we are all human beings."" He added that he erased the ""Black"" from Black Lives Matter because he felt in the beginning of the movement ""it had good intentions"" but now the phrase has been ""hijacked."" CNN could not reach Jim for comment because he has not released his last name. A 'blatant display of racism' Sharick moved into the neighborhood 27 years ago. She said this was the first time she ever faced with ""such a blatant display of racism."" ""He had that much time and energy to take time out of his day, every day, to bring water and come to my home and erase 'Black' from 'Black Lives Matter,'"" she added. ""It hurt. It hurt a lot. As a Black community we are heartbroken by everything done against us every day. We just want change."" After sharing the video on Instagram and Facebook on July 30, word began to spread. The next day, Sharick said dozens of people from in and out of the neighborhood showed up in front of Sharick's home with chalk to draw supporting messages all over the sidewalk on her side of the street and even in front of their own homes. One of these neighbors is Ilana Israel Samuels, who told CNN she refused to stay silent after finding out someone in her neighborhood was facing discrimination.  ""People need to stand with their Black neighbors in support. All lives can't matter until Black lives matter. Right now, Black lives are being harmed, murdered by police, and they are constantly living in fear,"" Samuels said. After neighbors left the sidewalk covered in positive messages encouraging love, hope, and kindness, as well as support for the Black Lives Matter movement, Sharick and her daughter continued to rewrite the message every day. Since the outpour of support, the man has not tried to erase the message again. ""I am deeply thankful and blessed for the special, unique, amazing people in my life who supported me, uplifted me and comforted me,"" Sharick said, ""My family and I are grateful for the help and support we have received from the community.""  While words can be washed away and chalk may fade, this community's message will stand forever."," After a White man repeatedly erased girl's 'Black Lives Matter' chalk drawing in front of her home, neighbors stepped in to show support for her.

 It was a lonely afternoon, but the video of a white police officer shot by a black suspect at a high-profile protest in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, grabbed the world's attention. It shows a white officer facing an armed black suspect as the two struggle over a Taser. The video, which has been viewed more than 500,000 times on Facebook, has sparked outrage and debate. Some people believe the video shows that the officer was justified in shooting the black man. Others say it shows that the officer was trying to justify his actions. There are three different versions of the video, which are being debated on social media. One says that the officer shot the man in self-defense. The other says the officer was justified in shooting the man. The third says that the officer was justified in shooting the man. The debate started after the officer was shot by a Black Lives Matter demonstrator. CNN's Don Lemon said the video ""makes it look like the officer was justified in shooting the man in the video, when in fact he was not."" ""It's the officer's actions that matter,"" he said. ""It's the actions of the bystanders that matter, as well. The bystander who filmed the whole thing and shared it with his friends and family is not the officer in the video."" Some people say the video shows the officer's actions were justified. ""It's the totality of his actions that make it look like he did what he needed to do in order to protect himself and others,"" said Charles Kinsey, a criminology professor at the University of South Carolina. ""It's the totality of his actions that make it look like he was justified in the actions he took, but it's the totality of his actions that make it look like he was a racist."" Kinsey said the officer in the video ""had a clear reason to shoot him"" and that the police chief should be held accountable. ""There is no doubt in my mind that the officer was justified in his actions,"" Kinsey said. ""The totality of his actions was justified."" Kinsey said that the police chief should be fired and charged. ""You can't fire an officer,"" Kinsey said. ""He has the power to take a life. He has the power to take a life",553

As students lined up before the ceremony started, the school's principal pulled him away in front of other students and told him to take off the mask, Holmes told CNN.  Holmes had previously been told by another school official to take the mask off, so he eventually relented for fear to not being able to walk across the stage, he said.  ""I was so mad. I was shaking during the graduation, tapping my leg on edge...when it was over, I couldn't believe it,"" said Holmes. York Catholic had opted to give every student a face shield instead of a mask for the ceremony. Holmes's father, John, took to Facebook on Saturday saying that the school stifled his freedom of expression and jeopardized his health.  "" ... the capricious action taken against my son demonstrates that York Catholic High School has miles to go before they can put the ugliness of unconscious bias and racism to sleep. As a parent I will not stand for my son being humiliated publicly, having his basic human dignity crushed on what should have been one of the happiest days of his young life,"" he wrote in the post.  Both he and his wife were also wearing Black Lives Matter masks during the ceremony, he told CNN.  No masks with messages for graduation, school said In a statement August 2, Arthur Full, chairman of the York Catholic School Board, said it was standard ""decorum"" for students to not wear any messages and that any graduate would have been asked to remove it. Two other students previously asked and were given permission to wear a solid color mask under the face shield, unlike Dean, Full explained.  ""We wish to re-emphasize that York Catholic believes in the dignity of all human persons, and the equal treatment of all people. We encourage our students, faculty, and alumni to engage in personal conversation, continue to listen with open hearts, always strive for better understanding, and grow as a supportive community of love and respect,"" the statement continued.  Family says school didn't say no masks with messages  They were not told beforehand that masks with messages would be disallowed at the ceremony, the family said. They also dispute several assertions in the school statement. According to the family, Dean had his mask on throughout the day and did not just put it on right before the ceremony, as the school said. Also, Dean was publicly told to take off the mask, not privately, as the school statement notes. The family also says Dean didn't have his temperature taken prior to the ceremony, despite the school saying he did. The school declined to comment further beyond its original statement. ""The high school experience has been one thing after the other. He's had so many experiences that have really tried to belittle him and knock him down,"" said the father.  Going forward, Dean said he hopes to channel the graduation experience in his future studies at New York University in the fall. The incoming economics major said he will join NYU's Black Student Union and hopes that he will be able to link his experience to a class he will take this fall entitled ""Cultures and Contexts: African Diaspora.""

They were very disrespectful toward the police officers."" On Monday night, the US Attorney's Office in the Southern District of New York announced that it was filing a complaint against the officers involved in the arrest. The officers were not accused of violating the civil rights of the young man. ""The conduct depicted by the defendants is repugnant to the core values of the United States of America,"" said Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who announced the charges Tuesday. ""The defendants have demonstrated a pattern of behavior that is repugnant to the law and of a nature and degree that is repugnant to the dignity of the young men who they are sworn to serve and protect."" The officers were not accused of a crime. In a statement, a lawyer for the officers said that the officers acted within the law and had acted in self-defense. ""They have been cleared of any wrongdoing,"" said attorney Tom Rosenberger. ""They are grateful for the opportunity to prove their innocence before the court."" The officers were released on personal recognizance with pay and no jail time was served.
 The video shows the officers' actions as the teen and his mother sit in the front seat of a car. He is seen on the video kneeling on the hood of the car while still holding a BB gun. The video then cuts to black with a white text on the screen. ""I have a problem with BB guns. I don't like them,"" the text reads. ""I don't like people using them in my neighborhood,"" the text continues. The video does not show the shooting.

Broden said he was releasing Perry's name in an attempt to correct misinformation in the media. Last Saturday night, Perry was working as a driver for a ride-share company to make extra money and had just dropped off a client when he encountered the protest on Congress Avenue, the release said. Perry did not know the protest was taking place before turning onto Congress Avenue, the release said. People began beating on the car and a man now identified as Garrett Foster approached, carrying an assault-style rifle, and motioned for Perry to lower his window, the release said. Thinking the man was associated with law enforcement, Perry did so but then realized the man was not a law enforcement officer, the release said. ""It has now been confirmed by several witnesses that this individual with the assault rifle then began to raise the assault rifle toward Sgt. Perry,"" the news release said. ""It was only then that Sgt. Perry, who carried a handgun in his car for his own protection while driving strangers in the ride share program, fired on the person to protect his own life."" Somebody else fired on Perry's vehicle and he drove to safety and called police, the news release said. Fort Hood confirmed in a statement that Perry is a sergeant assigned to the 1st Cavalry Division. The statement said the base was cooperating with the Austin Police Department in its ongoing investigation No charges have been filed in the shooting and Austin police have not identified the shooter. A spokesman for the Austin Police Department said Friday police have not released the name of the person who shot Foster because the incident is still under investigation.  After the incident, Austin Police Chief Brian Manley said officers responded to a 911 call in which the caller stated they had just shot someone who had approached their car window and pointed a rifle at them. When officers arrived, they began resuscitation efforts on the 28-year-old Foster, but he died shortly after at a local hospital, Manley said. The driver accused of shooting Foster was brought in by police for questioning, and his handgun and car were secured for evidence, police said, and another person who fired their gun at the car was brought in for questioning. Both had a concealed handgun license and were released pending further investigation. Witnesses gave many accounts, including that the disturbance began when the vehicle started honking its horn, Manley said. Witnesses told police that Foster approached the car with an AK-47 assault-style rifle while others in the crowd began striking the vehicle. One witness to the shooting, James Sasinowski, told CNN that the driver of the car initiated the encounter by turning on Congress Avenue and accelerating toward the protesters. ""This was intentional. It was aggressive and he accelerated into a crowd of protesters,"" Sasinowski said. ""He could have waited for us to pass or he could have gone slowly. We would have allowed him to go through."" ""This was intentional,"" Sasinowski said in an interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo. ""It was aggressive and he accelerated into a crowd of protesters. He could have waited for us to pass or he could have gone slowly. We would have allowed him to go through."" Sasinowski said it was less than 10 seconds between the driver stopping his vehicle and when the shots were fired. He said he did not see whether Foster pointed his gun at the car and was about 20 feet away when he heard the first gunshots. He said he looked over his shoulder and saw the driver's arm fully extended out of the window and holding a handgun. The driver fired several more shots, Sasinowski said. ""I want to be very clear that the driver incited the violence, he accelerated into the crowd of people and he shot first,"" he said. In an interview with CNN affiliate KEYE, Broden said that Perry ""he does take that turn quickly, but this idea that he did that to run protesters down is absurd."" Broden also told the station that Perry was driving for the ride-sharing company Uber. CNN has reached out to the company for comment but has not yet heard back. Uber has a company policy prohibiting drivers from carrying weapons. The news release from Perry's attorney said that Perry did not flee the scene but called police as soon as reaching safety.  ""Sgt. Perry and his family deeply sympathize with the loss and grief being experienced by Mr. Foster's family,"" the news release said. ""Sgt. Perry is devastated by what happened."" Broden urged people who might want to criticize Perry to ""picture themselves trapped in a car as a masked stranger raises an assault rifle in their direction and reflect upon what they might have done if faced with the split second decision faced by Sgt. Perry that evening."""," A ride-share driver fatally shot a man at the Austin Black Lives Matter rally 'to protect his own life,' lawyer says' ""The next day, the driver was charged with capital murder. He was arraigned on that charge last week. The judge set bond at $500,000. At that hearing, defense attorney Andy Savage said the man was driving a vehicle with a loaded gun in the back and was trying to protect himself. ""The defendant never intended to harm Mr. Kelley,"" Savage said. ""The defendant had no intention of killing Mr. Kelley."" Police said the man was carrying a loaded .38-caliber handgun. Savage said the man's attorney didn't dispute the facts in the shooting. ""The defendant had no regard for the man's safety and even though he was aware of the dangers of driving a car with a loaded gun in the car, the defendant's reckless disregard for Mr. Kelley's safety was the reason why the car went off,"" he said. 'A little over a month ago' Police said the man's car was found a few miles from the rally site. The investigation into the shooting is ongoing. 'He just wanted to protect his own life' The rally was meant to draw attention to the recent killings of unarmed black men by police officers, and to raise awareness about police brutality. ""We're asking people to protest peacefully and peacefully engage in peaceful assembly,"" said Matt Gonzalez, organizer of the rally. ""But if you're going to protest peacefully, you need to be prepared to defend yourself, and we're going to work with the police to make sure that you do not take the lives of others."" Police said the man who was shot was wearing a mask, a vest and a ballistic vest. He was taken to a hospital with life-threatening injuries. The man was also shot by bystanders, according to the police department. A witness said the man was pointing a gun at the police, police said. Gonzalez said he did not witness the shooting. He said he was in the crowd and saw the man's arm go through the windshield and fall into the street. ""He just wanted to protect his own life,"" Gonzalez said. Gonzalez said the man who was shot was a member of the Proud Boys, a right-wing youth organization. ""They're more militarized and more intimidating now that they were before the rally,"" Gonzalez said. Gonzalez said the group was protesting police brutality and racism. ""They're trying to get rid of the police,"" he said. ""They're going to kill them.""
 A Chicago police officer was charged with first-degree murder Wednesday in the death of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald. The officer, Michael Brelo, was fired after being indicted on Tuesday by a federal grand jury. ""We want to make sure that this officer's actions do not reflect on the badge of the police department,"" Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy said. ""We want to make sure that he is held accountable for his actions."" Chicago police fired Brelo, 37, in February after he shot McDonald, a black teenager, in a schoolyard fight over a toy. The shooting sparked a wave of violence that killed 12 people, including three police officers. A source close to the investigation said that the police officer who shot McDonald was not the only officer involved in the incident. Investigators are looking into whether McDonald was the victim of a ""suicide by cop"" or if he was the target of a ""suicide by cop."" The officer was not the target of the gunfire, but prosecutors have said the fatal shot was justified. The officer's attorney has said he was not armed when he shot McDonald. ""The officer fired eight shots, and the fatal shots were not from the officer's weapon,"" McCarthy said. ""They were from a bystander's perspective. The officer was not in immediate danger."" ""This is a time of mourning,"" McCarthy said. ""We ask that our community mourns in peace."" The officer, who has not been charged, is white, and the bystander, who was not identified, is black. The shooting happened on Thursday night after a man allegedly pointed a gun at police officers, authorities said. Police said the man, later identified as 19-",835

First, he scored what turned out to be the game-winning shot by getting the offensive rebound on his own missed shot and laying it in. On the other end of the floor, he defended the Clippers' two stars, Kawhi Leonard and then Paul George, to deny the Clippers from scoring. The Lakers won, 103-101. The Utah Jazz defeated the New Orleans Pelicans 106-104. But the restart of the NBA season was bigger than basketball. Every NBA player kneeled during the national anthem, wearing ""Black Lives Matter"" shirts. In the wake of the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, NBA players and other athletes have been vocal in their calls for social justice as America reckons with racism and the deaths of Black Americans at the hands of police. James has been among the most outspoken NBA players. ""The game of basketball has always been bigger than just a ball and a rim and 10 guys on the floor, four referees,"" James said early Friday, speaking to Turner Sports following the Lakers' win.  ""We used this platform to spread a lot of positive, a lot of love throughout the course of the whole world,"" he continued.  The season was suspended on March 11 due to the coronavirus pandemic, but James, other players and the league hope this restart is a step in a positive direction.  ""We understand what's going on in society right now and we're using this NBA platform as the players, as the coaches, as organizations to continue to stand strong on that,"" he said. ""It's a good start, it's a good start tonight. It's great to have the NBA back and I hope our fans are proud of us tonight."" Why Black Lives Matter In June, James and other athletes formed More Than A Vote, aiming to protect Black voting rights. NBA stars Trae Young and Draymond Green, WNBA star Skylar Diggins-Smith and former NBA star and current commentator Jalen Rose are a few of the other athletes involved with More Than A Vote.  After Thursday's game, James stressed that while there's been progress and the league has been supportive of Black Lives Matters efforts, there's more work to be done.  ""In the past when we've seen progress, we've let our foot off the gas a little bit. We can't do that. We want to continue to keep our foot on the gas, continue to push forward, continue to spread love throughout America."" The fight against racism and police brutality is far from over, according to James. He and others want the momentum to continue because people are finally listening.  James also made sure to acknowledge how former NFL player Colin Kaepernick, who famously began kneeling during the national anthem prior to the start of NFL games in 2016, sacrificed his career to draw attention to the unjust deaths of Black Americans.  After the death of Floyd, James posted an image on Instagram with one side showing the officer kneeling on Floyd's neck and  Kaepernick kneeling on the other side with the words ""This... ... Is Why"" and the caption ""Do you understand NOW!!??!!?? Or is it still blurred to you?? #StayWoke."" In the years since Kaepernick's silent protests, more people are listening and rethinking their stances on systemic racism.  ""I hope we made Kaep proud,"" James said. ""I hope we continue to make Kaep proud. Every single day I hope I make him proud on how I live my life, not only out on a basketball floor but off the floor."" ""Kaep was someone who stood up when at times wasn't comfortable, when people didn't understand, when people refused to listen to what he was saying."""," NBA season restarts with a nod to Black Lives Matter and 2 games that went down to the wire. The Cavaliers will be in Houston tonight to take on the Rockets, who beat the Cavs in a first-round playoff game. In the series finale, the Rockets won in a game that was close until the last seconds, when LeBron James sent the game into overtime. It was the first time in NBA history that two teams had tied games in the first overtime period. The series, which has been a must-watch for sports fans, has been the stuff of legends for years. And it won't be the last.
 The news, which was first reported by CNN's Don Lemon, was first reported by The Wall Street Journal's Susan Slusser. The team said the three players will be released from their contracts. The league has not yet responded to CNN's request for comment. ""The league and the NBPA have reached an agreement that will provide a path forward for all players, officials and staff to achieve the financial and health benefits of being in the NBA,"" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. ""We look forward to working with all parties on this important and mutually beneficial agreement."" The players, who have not been paid by the league since mid-June, have been represented by NBPA and the Players Association for months. The league and NBPA reached a deal in the next few days. The deal will be made public on Friday. The NBA has been under fire in recent days over the treatment of players and teams. On Wednesday, the league and the NBPA announced a new policy that bans players and teams from using social media platforms to comment on player matters. ""This new policy is an important step in the right direction in that it will help protect the integrity of our game and the public's perception of it,"" said NBPA President John Bosley. ""We look forward to working with the NBA and all other stakeholders to make sure this important change is a success.""

Terrain, along with digital advertising agencies 14Four and Seven2, hired 16 artists to decorate and paint each letter in Black Lives Matter, according to CNN affiliate KXLY.  To some, though, it was insulting. The mural, completed less than two weeks ago, was vandalized on Wednesday.  But the community isn't letting the negative response hinder the effort. A fundraiser to restore the mural has already raised more than $10,000.  ""It took dozens of people working with love to make this project happen, and only one or two filled with hate to deface it,"" Terrain said in a statement posted to Facebook. ""We outnumber them, but we can't be still or silent.""  Artist Nicholas Sironka designed and painted the ""A"" in ""Black"" of the mural, a letter that received the brunt of the white paint. He wasn't surprised the mural had been vandalized, he told CNN. ""I just feel that the whole Black Lives Matter now to me has more meaning, unity of purpose. Everybody is unified to one purpose and that is eradicating inequality and injustice and all those things put together,"" he said.  Kiantha Duncan, vice president of the Spokane chapter of the NAACP, said she had a visceral reaction to seeing the photos.  ""This is extremely scary,"" Duncan said on local news station KHQ.

Terry Preuninger, a Spokane police spokesperson, told local outlet The Spokesman-Review the department had been made aware of the vandalism through media outlets but hadn't confirmed whether a formal complaint was filed. This isn't the only BLM mural that has been defaced in recent weeks. In Spokane, a mural of George Floyd was defaced with white paint, though it has now been restored. In Manhattan, the Black Lives Matter street mural outside Trump Tower has been defaced four times, despite just being completed on July 9. "," A Black Lives Matter mural is defaced with red, white and blue paint in Washington state. The message reads, ""I can't breathe."" The next day, police said they found a message in the mural that said, ""I can't breathe"" written on the side of the mural. The mural has since been painted over. The message in the mural has since been removed from the wall of the mural. CNN has reached out to the artist and the city of Seattle for comment. The city has yet to respond. The protest, which was organized by the Seattle Black Lives Matter, was one of several demonstrations across the country this weekend.

It went up on Greenwood Avenue, also called Black Wall Street, where in 1921 a white mob attacked black residents and burned black-owned businesses in what's known as the Tulsa Race Massacre.  Tulsa's City Council decided to weigh in on the mural after receiving another request, from pro-police group Back The Blue Tulsa, to paint their own message on another street in support of law enforcement officers. During the council's meeting on Wednesday, Senior Assistant City Attorney Mark Swiney argued such signs are not legal under the city's laws. ""There really isn't anything in our laws that makes a street into a canvas to convey a message or essentially make a sign out of a street surface,"" Swiney said.  He suggested that if a group wanted to paint a message or a slogan, they should do so on private property.  After hearing from Swiney and other city officials, city council members determined that if they allowed one group to paint on a street surface, they would have to extend the same permission to others. And so, the ""Black Lives Matter"" mural would have to be removed. ""It's not about the message or anything like that,"" Councilor Connie Dodson said during the meeting. ""I applaud it. It's great. But at the same point, it comes down to: yes, if you allow one, then you have to allow all of them."" Some councilors also brought up regulations from the Federal Highway Administration that prohibit crosswalk art, saying that the painted letters on the street surface could pose similar concerns.  ""For safety reasons, federal guideline reasons and city liability reasons, I would suggest that (painting on streets) not be allowed at all and that those First Amendment freedoms get expressed another way,"" Dodson said. Artist Ryan Rhoades, who helped organize the group of artists to pain the BLM mural, told CNN affiliate KOKI-TV that he wasn't surprised by the decision ordering its removal. But he said it had served its purpose, as it was up during Juneteenth and Trump's visit. Rhoades told Tulsa World that the team used ""water-based latex acrylic"" paint for the letters and that it wasn't intended to last forever. But the letters have yet to fade. CNN has reached out to Rhoades, but has not yet received a response. A spokeswoman for the mayor's office told CNN that the city did not yet have a timeline for when they would remove the mural."," A 'Black Lives Matter' mural on Tulsa's 'Black Wall Street' is being removed after city officials said it was never approved for placement on the building.

This is a business statement."" The mural, which was on the wall for about a month before it was removed, had already been vandalized with graffiti. ""The mural was a huge part of who we are,"" Mayor Bynum said. ""It was an iconic part of our history and we're trying to move it."" Mayor Bynum said he will keep the mural on display in his office but it will have to be relocated to a more suitable space. ""We have to move on, we have to move on, we have to move on,"" Bynum said.

""Due to your support of Black Lives Matter and the obvious lack of support or trust with the Douglas County Sheriff's Office, please do not feel the need to call 911 for help,"" the sheriff wrote in a public letter to the library system Monday. ""I wish you good luck with disturbances and lewd behavior, since those are just some of the recent calls my office has assisted you with in the past."" The sheriff and library system director said they discussed the issue the next day and agreed it had been an ""unfortunate circumstance of misunderstanding."" The meeting discussing the statement was meant to happen Tuesday but has now been rescheduled for an unspecified date. The library's proposed diversity statement said in part that it ""denounces all acts of violence, racism, and disregard for human rights. We support ""BlackLivesMatter. We resolutely assert and believe that all forms of racism, hatred, inequality, and injustice don't belong in our society."" It added that the system had signed the Urban Libraries Council's Statement on Race and Social Equity -- signed by 180 public libraries across the United States and Canada, committing to making their communities ""more inclusive and just."" Coverley's letter called the death of George Floyd, who died in Minneapolis police custody in May, ""tragic and preventable,"" but then said ""data simply does not support claims that law enforcement is systemically racist or structurally biased."" That language, as well as the letter's first four paragraphs, is taken word for word from a letter sent to leaders in Congress from multiple state attorney generals and sheriffs associations in June, asking for assistance in combating ""anti-police rhetoric."" But data has shown that Black Americans are at a greater risk of being killed by police, despite being less likely to pose an objective threat to law enforcement, according to research by Northeastern University Professor Matt Miller.  Other research, from George Mason University and the University of Georgia, found in 2018 that when it comes to misdemeanors, ""there is profound racial disparity in the misdemeanor arrest rate for most -- but not all -- offense types."" Tuesday, the day after Coverley's public letter, he and Douglas County Library Director Amy Dodson released a joint statement addressing the issue. The two had a ""very candid conversation,"" Dodson said in the statement.

""The library respects and supports the work of the Douglas County Sheriff's Office and appreciates everything they do to keep our community safe."" ""This has been a difficult time to be a law enforcement professional and can be disheartening when we perceive that our office may be under attack,"" Coverley said in the statement. ""My response was rooted in my belief that these issues need to be openly discussed in a way that values diversity and law enforcement."""," This sheriff said he wouldn't respond to calls at the county's library, after it expressed support for Black Lives Matter.

The officers involved in his death should be held accountable for their actions. The shooting of Wilson was just plain wrong,"" the group said.
 The results were clear: Black voters approved the first major change to the city charter since the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. The election of the first black mayor in the city's history was a major victory for the Black Lives Matter movement, which has long pushed for the formation of a police department of more diverse racial lines and a more activist bent. And it came as a week of protests and unrest in the city of Ferguson brought national attention to the problems of police brutality and racial discrimination faced by black communities. But what happened next was anything but celebratory. The police department was stripped of most of its powers, including the power to arrest protesters. The city also elected a new police chief and appointed a prosecutor to lead its criminal division. The changes were the first of a new direction for Ferguson's police department in years. The changes came after months of debate in the city's city council over what the changes would do. Among those who voted against the changes were the mayor, the police chief and the city's police chief. But the city council voted unanimously to approve the changes in a 13-9 vote. The mayor called the new direction ""a long overdue change in direction"" and said they would be ""implemented with the utmost vigor."" The changes were expected to take months to implement. The city council approved the changes at a meeting that was livestreamed on the city's website. Some protesters were among the members who spoke out against the changes.

""I want to be very clear that the driver incited the violence -- he accelerated into the crowd of people and he shot first,"" Sasinowski said. Foster, 28, was marching with other demonstrators during a protest in downtown Austin in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement on Saturday evening when he was shot. Witnesses gave many accounts including that the disturbance began when the vehicle started honking its horn, Austin Police Chief Brian Manley said. Witnesses also told police that Foster approached the car with an AK-47 assault-style rifle while others in the crowd began striking the vehicle. Sasinowski said he does not know if Foster pointed his gun at the driver and he hasn't heard any of the other witnesses say that happened. But, he said, the driver initiated the encounter. ""This was intentional. It was aggressive and he accelerated into a crowd of protesters,"" Sasinowski said. ""He could have waited for us to pass or he could have gone slowly. We would have allowed him to go through."" Police responded to a 911 call Saturday in which the caller stated that they had shot someone who had approached their car window and pointed a rifle at them, Manley said. When officers arrived, they began resuscitation efforts on Foster, but he died shortly after at a local hospital, Manley said. There will be an autopsy to determine the official cause and manner of Foster's death as the investigation continues, Austin police said. The driver accused of shooting Foster was brought in by police for questioning, and his handgun and car were secured for evidence, police said. Another person who fired their gun at the car was brought in for questioning. Both had a concealed handgun license and were released pending further investigation. Austin Police Association President Kenneth Casaday tweeted that Foster was ""looking for a confrontation and he found it,"" a stance he stood by Monday when he spoke to CNN's Chris Cuomo. ""Maybe in hindsight it wasn't the best thing to do, but I stand by what I did. ... I just think that it was the best thing for the community to know at that time,"" Casaday said. Casaday said Foster had been protesting in front of the City Manager's house with a rifle. ""You look like you're picking a fight when you're out standing in front of the city manager's house intimidating them,"" Casaday said."," Witness to Austin Black Lives Matter shooting says 'the driver incited the violence' A second video shows that the driver, later identified as a white male, incited the violence.

It shows the vehicle traveling at about 20 miles per hour and stops briefly at the intersection of two lanes of traffic before speeding north on Dr. Carroll Parkway. A witness to the shooting told CNN affiliate KTRK that she saw a white male, later identified as the driver, standing in the middle of the road and a young black man running across the road toward the driver. The witness said the young black man was shouting profanities. ""He was throwing rocks at the car. I was not expecting that because I was expecting to see a white male,"" she said. The witness said the young black man was yelling racial slurs and was yelling at the car as it sped away. ""He was screaming that he was going to kill the car,"" she said. ""He was yelling that he was going to kill the car and I was not expecting that."" The witness said she was not sure if the young black man was screaming racial slurs or if he was upset because he thought the car was going to stop.

Mark David Hutt was arrested and charged with criminal mischief and given a desk appearance ticket, Reilly said. The NYPD doesn't track the number of times the mural has been vandalized, Reilly said. CNN has previously reported on three separate incidents surrounding the mural last week.  CNN has reached out to the New York City mayor's office for comment and to determine if the office keeps track of how many times the mural has been vandalized.  Earlier this month, a spokeswoman for the mayor called the vandalism to the mural ""unacceptable"" and said the city ""will absolutely fix it."" Three separate incidents The mural was first vandalized about four days after it was created, when an unnamed suspect dumped red paint on the V in ""Lives."" The police department said it was investigating the vandalism. On July 17, surveillance video captured three individuals ""pouring and smearing paint on the mural and one female spreading flyers at the scene,"" police said. When police arrived, they arrested four people who had blue paint on their hands and clothing. The latest incident occurred last weekend, when two women from Staten Island were arrested after they were seen pouring paint on the mural.  New York City's mural, similar to the one commissioned by Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser, was painted on Fifth Avenue in front of Trump Tower earlier this month. The building is home to the Trump Organization's headquarters. President Donald Trump has called the words ""Black Lives Matter"" a ""symbol of hate"" and sharply criticized New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio in a tweet for ""denigrating this luxury Avenue."" The mayor responded, ""Here's what you don't understand: Black people BUILT 5th Ave and so much of this nation.

21,https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/26/us/black-lives-matter-explainer-trnd/index.html, How Black Lives Matter went from a hashtag to a global rallying cry," It was July 2013 and George Zimmerman was on trial for murder in the killing of Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old Black boy who had been walking in his father's Florida neighborhood. The night the verdict was set to be announced, Alicia Garza and some friends gathered for drinks. None of them thought  Zimmerman would be acquitted on all charges. But that's what happened. And Garza felt like she'd been punched in the gut, she told MSNBC. That night Garza woke up in the middle of the night crying. So she began writing out how she felt, in an emotional Facebook post. She wrote that she continued to be surprised ""at how little Black lives matter."" ""That's really what Black Lives Matter was for me,"" Garza told MSNBC. ""And that's why I said Black people, I love you. I love us. And that our lives matter. And that we matter. And that Black lives matter."" The phrase ""Black lives matter"" inspired Garza's friend, Patrisse Cullors, to create a hashtag. Almost instantly, it went viral.  ""I wanted it to go viral,"" Cullors, who co-founded Black Lives Matter with Garza and Opal Tometi, told CNN.  ""On July 15th, 2013 I said that Alicia and I had created a thing called #BlackLivesMatter and we hope that it will be bigger than we can ever imagine,"" Cullors said. ""Over the last seven years we've developed more infrastructure and we've become more organized."" Momentum around the movement has grown amid calls for justice following the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd. The phrase ""Black Lives Matter"" is being used now as more than just a hashtag -- it's a rallying cry. At protests, it's what many demonstrators write on their signs or chant as they march. Online, it's what many have used to spread the message against police brutality. And globally, it's being used by many to show solidarity with Black people. While many believe the movement is more accepted than it once was, others remain skeptical of what it accomplishes and question its impact. Here's what you need to know about the evolution of the movement, and why it matters. Growth of a movement Black Lives Matter is one of the most well-known organizations fighting for the well-being of Black people. Studies show that segregation persists in many American cities, leaving majority Black communities behind. BLM's goal, according to its website, is to eradicate anti-Blackness and create a society where Black people are able to thrive in the US.  ""We live in a country built to keep us away from these resources that we need,"" said Kailee Scales, managing director of the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation.  Scales referenced the data. Police officers are almost four times as likely to use force on Black people than White people. Black people are also jailed at a disproportionate rate. Black Americans have lower access to health care and lack the same access to quality education. ""Folks in the movement have been consistently fighting to reverse that trend, to raise awareness that this is not the way we're supposed to live,"" Scales told CNN. Since the hashtag launched, the organization has become more formalized, taken on specific branding and branched out into nationwide chapters -- all in an attempt to solidify the group and allow them to create national campaigns while engaging the broader community. Organizers put together a website, which led to the development of local chapters of BLM, first in Los Angeles in 2013 and then throughout the country, according to Scales. After the protests in Ferguson, Missouri, against police brutality in 2014, the organization became more well known. In 2017 it became incorporated as the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, Inc. Today the network consists of 13 official chapters in the US, plus three more in Canada, according to the BLM website. Local chapters are semi-autonomous, meaning they ""do the work that makes sense"" for their communities, Scales said. The structure allows the group to have an impact at all levels -- doing work both nationally and locally, she said. Each chapter works a little differently and has different focuses, depending on community needs.  The Chicago chapter, for example, focuses more on police accountability, while the Boston chapter does a lot of activity around mutual aid, Scales said. In Los Angeles BLM activists have been at the forefront of the defund police movement, meeting with local politicians about a proposal they call the People's Budget, which would reallocate funding from the Los Angeles Police Department.  The group has called for defunding the police for at least five years, Black Lives Matter Los Angeles co-founder Melina Abdullah told CNN. The most recent push began in May, and at the time the chapter had little support from local politicians. After George Floyd's killing, however, the group gained momentum and received some support from a few members of the Los Angeles City Council. In June, after pressure from BLMLA and massive protests, the council unanimously approved a measure to develop an unarmed model of crisis response that would replace police officers with community-based responders for nonviolent calls.  Following the vote, City Councilmember Herb Wesson Jr., who authored the motion with Council President Nury Martinez, said in a tweet that he looks ""forward to continuing this work alongside"" BLMLA. And there is more work to be done, Abdullah said.  ""(We) never thought that that (amount) was anywhere near enough,"" she told CNN. ""But it's a step forward that we forced."" The different chapters are bound by a set of guiding principles, which work to ground the individual entities.  But they also work together. Chapters tend to work across state lines, Abdullah told CNN. When the BLM chapter in South Bend, Indiana, was getting started, Abdullah said the group worked closely with BLMLA -- specifically comparing notes on the terms of mayors Pete Buttigieg and Eric Garcetti.  It's worth noting that not every protest or demonstration is part of the Black Lives Matter network, as some may be organized by people simply using the movement's name. And not every person attending a BLM protest is a part of their local BLM chapter.  The movement is largely decentralized, with no one besides managing director Scales receiving pay, said Abdullah, who also works as a professor at California State University in Los Angeles.  Chapters tend to have a loose leadership structure, with a focus on on-the-ground organizing -- allowing chapters the autonomy to organize in the way they see fit.  Until George Floyd's death, Abdullah said BLMLA had only raised $100,000 in the last seven years, money that it used for ""the basic cost of organizing,"" things like renting rooms, making copies, printing banners and hiring unarmed security. They also try to provide limited support to families who lose members to police brutality, like aiding with funeral costs, which Abdullah said can sometimes run up to $20,000. And unless money is earmarked specifically for the local chapters, money donated through the main network goes to the larger global network, Abdullah said. Chapters can ask for a little money from the national organization, but it's not always a significant amount, she said. But with donations streaming in after Floyd's death, BLMLA has more money than it has ever had.  ""We're stepping back to take a minute and process what we should be doing with the newfound money that we've never had before,"" she said. 'All Lives Matter' and other backlash With more notoriety comes more scrutiny, and the Black Lives Matter movement has experienced its fair share of criticism.  Some have said while they support the movement's cause, they are not a fan of its approach, contrasting some of the protests today to the peaceful ones of the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Many have condemned the more progressive demands of the cause, most notably the call to defund the police, which would instead invest those funds in communities, especially marginalized ones where much of the policing occurs. Like Abdullah said, the call to defund the police has been a key priority of the movement for years. But as these calls increase, police unions across the country have dug in to protect their own -- even though the movement has support from organizations like Amnesty International and video evidence of officers using excessive force against protesters.  And the notion still faces pushback from people on both sides of the political aisle. President Donald Trump has defended the police. Meanwhile, politicians like Gov. Tony Evers of Wisconsin, a Democrat, has said defunding goes too far.  Others have called the movement too radical. In Arizona, Rep. Walt Blackman, a Black GOP member of the Arizona Legislature, labeled BLM a ""terrorist organization"" in an interview with Fox News Radio affiliate KFYI. He then told the Arizona Republic in a follow up interview that BLM is an ""ideology that goes against the very concepts and precepts of our principles in the United States."" Critics have also responded to the phrase ""Black Lives Matter"" by coining their own slogans, such as ""All Lives Matter,"" which some argue minimizes the current struggle Black people face against systemic racism, and ""Blue Lives Matter,"" referring to the lives of police. Trump previously called the words ""Black Lives Matter"" a ""symbol of hate"" in a tweet criticizing New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio for ""denigrating"" Fifth Avenue in Manhattan with a BLM mural. Still, Michael Kazin, who studies social movements at Georgetown University, said it's surprising that the movement hasn't received more backlash. He said it's the first time in history that a movement focused on Black equality has seen this kind of support from White people. ""Even in the '60s, with the (March on Washington), polls at the time never had more than 15, 20% support among Whites,"" Kazin, who is also the co-editor of the democratic-socialist publication Dissent Magazine, told CNN. There's been an outpouring of support from diverse populations, he said. He used Portland, Oregon, as an example, where federal officers have used tear gas and force against on majority-White protesters.  ""We're seeing huge crowds in little cities, or even where there's hardly any Black people,"" Kazin said. ""That's new. That didn't happen in the '60s, or even in 2013."" Why people are rallying behind BLM It's been said that this moment feels different. It's bigger, more mainstream. White people are protesting just as much as people of color.  Even large corporations and brands, which may have been silent in the past, are getting involved.  Last month NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said ""Black Lives Matter"" in an apology video, a far cry from the league's stance during the 2016-17 season, when Colin Kaepernick became increasingly vocal about police brutality to the chagrin of the league. Kaepernick has not been with a team since.  Companies like Peloton, Disney, Facebook and others have spoken up against racial injustice, while the CEO of Netflix donated $120 million to historically Black colleges and universities.  Taylor Swift, who previously stayed away from anything remotely controversial, has voiced her support for the BLM movement, and even called for the removal of Confederate monuments in Tennessee. Meanwhile, Seth Rogen, Steve Carrell and others have donated to bail funds for protesters. With the rise of social media in the 2010s, images showing police brutality against Black people have reached a much wider audience. Now a whole generation has grown up exposed to the issue of systemic racism. Or, as Minneapolis community organizer Shanene Herbert put it, the trauma. ""They (young people) have experienced trauma,"" she told CNN. ""Seeing your friends, your families and even yourself harassed by the police and killed by the police, it's traumatic. And they don't know what to do with that."" More people are demanding change. And BLM has been a big motivator in that shift. Mary Westbrook, who lives in Philadelphia and participated in the city's protests in June, told CNN that she felt it was important for her to support the movement.  Westbrook, who is White, was among a group of demonstrators that was sprayed with tear gas. Afterward, she shared an image of herself on Twitter, noting her ""face and eyes are on fire."" ""I've lived in this city for 16 years,"" the 38-year-old told CNN in a Twitter message in June. ""I am a children's librarian at the library right there on the Parkway (which is why I know the area and streets there really well). I see every day what black and other POC are dealing with in this city."" In the last seven years, BLM activists have made their message mainstream, according to Marcia Chatelain, author of ""Franchise: The Golden Arches in Black America.""  ""There's been a shift in the public and a willingness to engage with their ideas,"" Chatelain, an American studies professor at Georgetown University, told CNN. For example, she said, ""people are willing to take a second to understand what defunding the police and prison abolition are all about."" What the future holds When asked what she hopes for BLM's future, co-founder Cullors said she knows the movement will win.  ""I know this because our work is full of love, healing and dignity,"" she said. ""And we center Black people's humanity and life over our death and decimation."" The task isn't an easy one. Kazin, the Georgetown professor, pointed out that the BLM movement is about power -- having power to decide how policing will look, or having power to access quality education.  BLM signs in windows, anti-racist reading lists -- all these things are good, Kazin said. But unless they are coupled with a true shift in power and larger political solidarity efforts, little will change.  Still, people are listening now. And Scales, like Cullors, is optimistic. ""At this point, we don't stop,"" she said. ""We're not able to relax. It's now the opportunity to push for the true transformation that we've been working for."""," How Black Lives Matter went from a hashtag to a global rallying cry in the wake of the deaths of unarmed African-American men by police. Many protesters have called for the Black Lives Matter movement to take on a broader political agenda, and some have even gone as far as to call for the assassination of police officers. But the movement has largely avoided overt political statements. At the same time, the movement has made a few controversial statements. One of the most prominent was when it called for the ""immediate and unconditional release"" of Dylann Roof, a white man who shot and killed nine black church members in Charleston, South Carolina. The group has also called for the release of videos showing police misconduct. While the group has said it will not use violence, the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, is a prime example. That case, which spurred the Black Lives Matter movement, became a catalyst for protests around the world. In the weeks after Brown's death, demonstrators have marched, staged sit-ins and even rioted in some cities. What do you think? Do you agree that the Black Lives Matter movement has run out of ideas?
 The death of 25-year-old Michael Brown, who was unarmed, has reignited Black Lives Matter protests. Protesters have been calling for justice in his death since the officer, Darren Wilson, shot him dead in August 2014. CNN has been unable to reach Brown's family for comment. The city of Ferguson has not responded to CNN's request for comment. The protests have taken a violent turn since the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown by a white police officer in August 2014. Black Lives Matter activists say the attacks have led to a rise in police brutality and racial violence. ""We're seeing a rise in the number of police brutality cases, particularly against African-Americans,"" said Darryl Alexander, a professor of criminal justice at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. ""The violence against African-Americans is not new. The violence against people of color is. The violence against African-Americans is now being directed at African-Americans in a much more vicious and brutal way."" It's a stark contrast from the early years of the movement, when the Black Lives Matter movement focused on issues of police brutality and racial injustice. ""The movement was more of a protest movement than anything else,"" Alexander said. ""It was a lot of push-pull in terms of what activists were doing and what politicians were doing. The idea of what we want to see happen in the world is much more important to people than what we see in real life."" 'We don't need any more police brutality' CNN is having trouble finding people willing to talk about the protests. People are ""switching from one thing to another,"" said Alex Heinemeier, a CNN political commentator. ""We don't need any more police brutality. We don't need any more police militarization. We just need to get back to the way things used to be."" Heinemeier said the movement is ""going to be the most difficult thing about going forward for a lot of people."" ""There will be a lot of anger,"" he said. ""A lot of frustration. A lot of frustration."" But, he said, ""I think that the anger will be directed at the government, at the police and at some of the other issues that have caused it. The anger will be directed at the things that have led to this point."" A CNN/ORC poll from July found that nearly three-quarters of Americans say police use excessive force against people of color, including at least 40% who say they have used a chokehold. But even among those who say they have used a chokehold, 58% say the tactic is rarely used by police, and 34% say it is sometimes used by police. The poll also found that more than half of those who have used a chokehold say they have used it only once, and only a quarter of those who say they have used it in the past have used it in the past. The poll results show that anger is not a factor in the protests. ""What we're seeing is that the protests are becoming a part of everyday life for a lot of Americans. They're not just a 'Black Lives Matter' thing,"" said Alexander. ""They're also a part of the broader American experience."" 'We're all feeling the pain' The protests have been fueled by a number of different sources, but one that has been especially potent is the video of Michael Brown's death. The footage captured the horrific aftermath of the fatal shooting by a white police officer, Darren Wilson, while he was driving his police car. The fatal shooting of Brown, an unarmed black man, sparked outrage and protests across the country. People across the country took to the streets in a show of solidarity with Brown's family and call for justice. ""What's really powerful about the video is that it shows not just what happened but also what people are feeling. It shows us all that there are people all",1023
22,https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/24/us/black-lives-matter-why-i-march-trnd/index.html, The three reasons Black Lives Matter marchers refuse to quit," Even if there aren't tens of thousands of people flooding the streets as they did at the beginning of the summer, the demonstrators carry on -- unafraid of police presence and unrelenting in the face of potential coronavirus infections.  Each has their own reason. Some personally experienced the sting of police brutality. Some demand things need to change.  For their unique motivations, all of them agreed -- this work has become a vital part of who they are.  Here are three reasons why they still march.  To maintain momentum Before the pandemic, 22-year-old Tyrell Taylor and 12 of his friends used to get together and do anything they could to stay active. Those meetups came to a screeching halt once New York started shutting down in March. To beat the boredom, they formed a group called MBR, or Mind, Body, Results, for organized bike rides.  After the death of George Floyd, those leisurely rides became acts of protest.  The group meets every Friday at 6 p.m. with a few exceptions. They've occupied the Brooklyn Bridge, Washington Square Park and Times Square, among other iconic New York locales. At their largest protest, Taylor and his friends rode with 1,000 cyclists.  Clogging the streets with bikes is both disruptive and peaceful, Taylor, a graduate student at Medaille College, told CNN. Their bikes have become their platforms for anti-racism.  ""Our main focus is to be a community, a family,"" Taylor said, ""Without that, we're just a bunch of strangers yelling 'Black Lives Matter' and that's not what we want to create, we want people to know and be familiar with what they're going into the protest to achieve."" The group's founding members have all experienced dehumanizing encounters with police -- racial profiling, police brutality, stop-and-frisk. Like many Black Lives Matter protesters, they're calling to defund the city's police department. NYPD funding accounts for around 6% of the city's overall budget. Taylor has had to cancel protests at times, but the group would come back the following week stronger. Quitting would mean throwing away almost two months of progress, Taylor said ""I would say, even if you feel like it's getting repetitive, if you're getting tired of doing it, continue to do it, because they're waiting for you to stop,"" he said. ""And knowing that they're waiting for us to stop, makes us want to go twice as hard."" Taylor said he thinks now the movement for Black lives is peaking.  ""People are falling off, but it's our job to maintain this peak.""  To be an ally Florida native William Kilgore has hardly gone a day without marching for Black lives since protests began in May. He's documented the demonstrations in St. Petersburg, a burgeoning city along the state's Gulf Coast, on Twitter since their inception, and he said he's seen them grow more unified, even if turnout is lower than it was initially. ""You have to understand that this is a marathon, not a sprint,"" he told CNN. ""I'd say the focus and organization is actually much stronger than it was on day one.""  Kilgore, who is White, said his community appears to be progressive, but the Black Lives Matter movement has laid bare inequalities in education, income and opportunity within the city.  ""Racism is still deeply ingrained in every institution of this city,"" he said.  The St. Petersburg Police Department showed it was receptive to change this month when it announced it will dispatch social workers to some non-violent calls instead of uniformed officers.  It's a start, said Kilgore, who support defunding the police department, but ""not enough to satiate people's thirst for true equality."" The announcement came around the same time police began to fine protesters for blocking the street.  Florida has its hands full with the coronavirus pandemic with nearly 400,000 cases, and St. Petersburg is no exception with over 14,000 of those cases. But Kilgore said attention must continue to be paid to the movement for Black lives.  ""I plan on staying the course as long as it takes to achieve radical change here in St. Pete,"" he said. ""I am in it for the long haul."" To disrupt the status quo Fargo, North Dakota, didn't have a formal Black Lives Matter chapter until a few days after the death of George Floyd, when four residents coalesced to found the organization's Fargo-Moorhead branch.  They've had to become a family fast.  Before they joined the Black Lives Matter board, they advocated for Black lives in Fargo in different ways: Kiara Jackson is president of North Dakota State University's Black Student Association, where she met fellow board member and graduate student Frederick Edwards Jr. There's Faith Dixon, who runs a daycare and nonprofit in Fargo, and Jamaal Abegaz works with the local Democratic Socialists group.  For their differences in background and age, they're a formidable team. They've led several marches since May 30 in their predominantly White community and met with local officials to plead for change.  Their work energizes them. It's also made them targets, they told CNN.  They've been told their protests ""make the town look bad."" Abegaz said he's received death threats.  ""Just the simple act of saying that things need to change and that we're not going to go along with the status quo puts our lives in harm,"" Abegaz said.  The violence of the first protest has affected subsequent turnout. The initial march after Floyd's death attracted over 3,000 participants. Now up to 300 people join them, the group told CNN.  Dixon said they've been painted as the enemy, which intimidates residents from joining them.  ""We are citizens of this community which we love,"" Dixon said. ""I own a business here. Our families are here. Why would we want to see a city we care so much about be ruined ... We're four individuals that have a right to speak and have a right to protest, and why is it such a huge fight just to do that?""  Among their demands are defunding the police, or reallocating some of the police department's budget to social services like education and public health. They want a police oversight board that doesn't include police, and they want new police recruits to complete a college-level course about the cultural diversity of the area. And they've asked police to immediately end their use of force, including the use of tear gas and rubber bullets at protests.  The demonstrators will hold as many more protests as it takes for those changes to come, Dixon said. Their work has become a part of who they are. ""We're organizing for our lives,"" Abegaz said. ""We have to live, so we're not going to live under somebody's boot."" "," The three reasons Black Lives Matter marchers refuse to quit: We won't stop fighting. We'll keep fighting. We'll make our voices heard. We'll never give up.
 Police officers and protesters are planning to march peacefully through downtown Minneapolis on Saturday night, but Minneapolis police say they will have officers on the ground in the city's downtown core. ""Minneapolis police officers will be on the ground downtown,"" Minneapolis Police Chief Janee Harteau said in a statement. ""Minneapolis Police officers will be on the ground at City Hall, where City Council will be meeting."" A protest is scheduled for Saturday at a downtown park. Demonstrators have been planning to protest since the death of George Floyd in police custody. ""The protest will be peaceful, but it will be extremely disruptive to the city,"" Harteau said. ""We will not tolerate any violence, destruction of property, or arrests."" A large group of people are expected to gather at a park in the city's Kendall Square neighborhood, where demonstrators have been marching since the weekend. ""This is not a protest. This is a planned event,"" Harteau said. ""We do not want to cause any disruption to the normal functioning of the city."" The march is expected to start at 3 p.m. ET (10 a.m. PT) and end at 5:30 p.m. (6:30 p.m. ET). It is expected to draw a large crowd.
 Police are keeping an eye on two women who they say may be part of the planned protest. Police say they are keeping an eye on two women who they say may be part of the planned protest.
 The investigation into the shooting death of George Floyd continued Monday with the filing of a charge of voluntary manslaughter. Floyd's family: We want justice, not change The justice system must not be used to ""perpetuate social control and racial subordination,"" said Mark Levin, a co-founder of the American Conservative, in a statement. ""We want a fair, just, and lasting investigation into this case. We want our community to be safe and free from fear and violence. We want to see a swift, fair, and just resolution of the case. We want our community to have confidence in the justice system. We want to see a race-based prosecution of the case,"" he said. ""We want to see a thorough and transparent investigation of the case. We want to see an end to police brutality and all forms of injustice."" Floyd died on July 5, 2017, after a Minneapolis police officer shot him in the back as he lay dying. The video of the incident, captured by a bystander, sparked outrage and protests around the country. The police department has said Floyd was armed, but there are no videos or photos of Floyd's death or of the aftermath of the shooting. Floyd's family: We want change, not change, the family's attorney said in a statement. ""We want to see the changes that we can make in our community, but the justice system has failed us. The system has failed our family and our community,"" he said. ""We want to see real change, not an immediate, symbolic change. We want to see real change, not a perceived change, and we want to see real change, not a made-up change, that will result in more incidents of police brutality, more deaths of unarmed black men, and a larger percentage of black males behind bars.""
 The shooting of Floyd, who was unarmed, sparked outrage and protests around the country. Floyd's death spurred the Black Lives Matter movement, which has since spread to include other civil rights groups, including the Black Lives Matter National Association. Activists have been demanding justice for Floyd since his death. Activists have been calling for Floyd's arrest and the prosecution of the officers involved in his death. Floyd was shot by Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin in the back as he lay dying after being hit with a stun gun. Floyd was unarmed when he was shot.

23,https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/23/us/opening-day-baseball-mlb-black-lives-matter-trnd/index.html, Baseball is making Black Lives Matter center stage on Opening Day," For decades, fans have claimed baseball often mirrors society and in 2020, that rings true -- and loudly.   Opening Day should normally bring fans, awakening from winter hibernation, to ballpark grandstands adorned with American flag bunting. Covid-19 means those major league ballparks are largely silent, save for the crack of a bat -- there are no fans in the stands. But Major League Baseball, teams and players are also using this Opening Day to place Black Lives Matters center stage.  ""BLM,"" accompanied by the MLB's logo, has been stamped onto the pitcher's mound of the World Series-defending Washington Nationals --and the Los Angeles Dodgers -- on Thursday night. That's the most prominently displayed ballpark location during a television broadcast. On Friday morning, the Tampa Bay Rays sent a tweet, saying, ""Today is Opening Day, which means it's a great day to arrest the killers of Breonna Taylor.""  The Boston Red Sox endorsed the message, retweeting it to their 2.1 million followers. The left sleeve of some of the four teams player jerseys -- the Nationals, New York Yankees, Los Angeles Dodgers and San Francisco Giants --  have patches reading, ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""United for Change,"" alongside what the MLB says is an, ""inverted MLB logo where the silhouetted batter is black."" It's first time that logo has been used on the field. Both the Nationals and Yankees players came to the field during pre-game batting practice in shirts reading, ""Black Lives Matter."" On the West Coast, the Los Angeles Dodgers posted a tweet showing Kenley Jansen, Edwin Rios, Kike Hernandez, Matt Beaty and Corey Seager wearing Black Lives Matter shirts ahead of their game against the San Francisco Giants at Dodger Stadium. Prior to the playing of the National Anthem, teams took to the field and held a black ribbon-like fabric and kneeled -- every player and coach.   ""Today, and every day, we come together as brothers,"" actor Morgan Freeman read as players knelt. ""As equals, all with the same goal -- to level the playing field. To change the injustices. Equality is not just a word. It's our right."" It's all part of a new policy from the MLB, according to a document obtained by CNN, drafted after the league held discussions with the Players Association, the Players Alliance and individual players.   ""MLB stands in solidarity with the Black community in the fight for racial and social justice,"" the document reads.   ""MLB recognizes more needs to be done. MLB will continue to listen to the Black community including MLB players, The Players Alliance and MLB and Club staff about this issue; enhance initiatives to improve Black representation in baseball on and off-the-field; expand charitable donations to social justice organizations; and continue to amplify the voices of our players."" The league has also reversed its policy on messages written on player cleats.  According to the document, players will now be able to, ""express themselves with social justice messages and causes,"" during the 2020 season. Baseball may have been one of the first professional sports leagues to integrate, but it continues to reckon with the racism of its past.  For decades, Major League Baseball owners colluded to prevent the signing of any Black players, who ended up forming their own leagues commonly known as the Negro Leagues.  That changed in 1946, when Brooklyn Dodgers owner and general manager Branch Rickey signed Negro Leaguer Jackie Robinson, who became the first Black major leaguer in 1947. In late June, the Minnesota Twins removed a statue honoring Calvin Griffith from outside the team's ballpark. Griffith had once said to a crowd he'd moved his baseball team from Washington to Minneapolis because they had fewer Black people."," Baseball is making Black Lives Matter center stage on Opening Day. The White House is also reportedly considering hosting a ""Black Lives Matter"" rally. On Tuesday, the White House said it had not yet decided whether to host the event. The White House did not respond to CNN's request for comment. ""The White House is committed to honoring the legacy of the Black Lives Matter movement, but in a time of national and international tragedy, we must also remember our own history, and the role that race plays in shaping who we are today,"" the White House said in a statement. ""We will not allow our history to be used to justify a set of policies that are not in the best interests of our country, our people, or our future."" The White House did not respond to a CNN request for comment on whether the White House would hold a ""Black Lives Matter"" rally or if the White House would hold a similar event in a future. The White House has not responded to CNN's requests for comment regarding any plans to hold a ""Black Lives Matter"" rally. The White House did not respond to questions regarding the nature of the planned ""Black Lives Matter"" rally. On Sunday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told CNN that the White House is not planning to hold a ""Black Lives Matter"" rally. ""The White House is not planning on hosting a Black Lives Matter rally in the White House,"" she said. ""The White House is committed to ensuring that every American feels safe and supported."" Sanders added that the White House does not plan to host a ""White Lives Matter"" rally. ""We are not planning on hosting a White Lives Matter rally, but the White House has not made a decision on whether it will hold a rally on its property,"" she said. ""White Lives Matter rallies are not a White House priority, so the White House is not planning on hosting any rally on its property."" On Sunday, the White House issued a statement saying that the White House is ""not planning on hosting any White Lives Matter rallies."" ""The White House has made it clear that White Lives Matter rallies, including the White House, will not be invited to the White House,"" the White House statement said. ""The White House is committed to ensuring that everyone feels safe and supported during this time of national tragedy.""
 This week, the Supreme Court heard arguments in a case that could shape the future of race and policing. The high court will decide whether police officers' use of deadly force is unconstitutional. The case centers on whether a police officer can use deadly force against a suspect who is fleeing police. The outcome of the case could have implications for how police conduct themselves on the streets. The 5-4 decision could lead to changes in the way police conduct themselves and how they interact with citizens. But the reaction from some in the black community has been muted. ""It's a very complicated case, and it's going to take time to understand all the facts of the case,"" said Shauna A. Wilson, a civil rights attorney and CNN political commentator.

""Recognizing that we have work to do ourselves, we wanted to show that we stand with those who are working to achieve racial equity,"" Red Sox spokeswoman Zineb Curran told CNN in a statement. ""The billboard is operated by the Red Sox Foundation and one of the ways we plan to feature the Black Lives Matter movement throughout the baseball season as a way to amplify the voices of those who share our values, but may not share our platform."" Though the Red Sox have not spoken publicly about the billboard, manager Ron Roenicke said earlier this week that he supports any players who wish to take a knee, a gesture in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.  The Red Sox Foundation website also features a June statement from president and CEO Sam Kennedy, condemning the murders of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor, calling them ""stark reminders that racism and police brutality continue to be pervasive in America.""  ""I am so grateful to my teammates who consistently remind me that the Red Sox have an obligation to amplify the voices of those who share our values, but do not share our platform.  Silence in the face of injustice is unacceptable,"" he wrote. Last month, the foundation also tweeted that as part of its ""commitment to amplify social justice,"" it has put together a resource guide ""outlining educational materials and recommended ways to help."""," The Boston Red Sox put up a Black Lives Matter billboard over the Massachusetts Turnpike in the hopes of drawing in fans and attracting business. ""We wanted to make sure that the message was clear that we are not going to tolerate racism, and we are going to fight against it,"" said Boston Mayor Marty Walsh. ""We are going to make sure that every aspect of our lives, our neighborhoods and our city are going to be safe for everyone."" The Boston Police Department is not the first to put up a billboard. The city's Department of Public Works had one up for about a week, city officials said. The Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees also have billboards around the country featuring a Black Lives Matter logo. ""We're trying to get the message out that our city and our country are moving toward more inclusion and compassion and understanding toward people of color,"" Walsh said. ""We're also trying to educate ourselves and the general public as to what is happening in the world."" The Boston Police Department has not yet responded to CNN's request for comment about the billboard or other billboards that have been put up in the city.

25,https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/23/us/black-lives-matter-protests-continue/index.html, Black Lives Matter protests across America continue nearly 2 months after George Floyd's death," Portland, Oregon, has remained a flashpoint of national and global demonstrations that erupted after video emerged of Floyd pleading that he couldn't breathe as a police officer pinned him to the ground with a knee to the back of his neck for nearly nine minutes.  As in other parts of the country, the protests in Portland were mostly peaceful, though they have at times devolved into violence, vandalism and arson.  Protesters last weekend pulled down barricades, moved them into streets and attempted to set a building on fire. On Sunday, federal law enforcement officers dispersed protesters with gas, police said. Nearly two months after Floyd's death set off massive national and international protests, Black Lives Matter demonstrations are still happening in some places, including:  Chicago, Illinois Protesters gathered near the home of Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot on Saturday -- one day after violent clashes left police and demonstrators injured, CNN affiliate WLS reported.  The demonstrators accused police of using excessive force to quell a protest on Friday which targeted a statue of Christopher Columbus at Grant Park.  Police said 18 officers were injured after some people in the crowd used rocks, fireworks, frozen bottles and other objects to attack officers, according to a statement. About 12 people were arrested, police said. Lightfoot, a Democrat, said she supports individuals' right to protest but condemned some protesters and police officers. Activists with Black Lives Matter Chicago demanded the immediate defunding of the police department.   The Civilian Office of Police Accountability (COPA) confirmed it was investigating ""numerous complaints"" of police misconduct. Los Angeles, California Black Lives Matter protesters in Los Angeles, chanting and holding signs, have been calling for the ouster of L.A. County District Attorney Jackie Lacey for two and a half years.  Lacey is the county's first Black and female prosecutor. She was raised in South Los Angeles.  Demonstrators have gathered nearly every Wednesday, but their calls have intensified since Floyd's death. They blame Lacey, a Democrat, for what they see as an unwillingness to prosecute police officers. Lacey said she has more in common with protesters than they realize, and that in many of the cases they cite, she was handcuffed by the law. ""While you may look at a shooting by an officer and say, 'Oh, they could have shot him in the leg, they didn't have to respond that way,' that's not the test under California law,"" Lacey said. ""The test is when somebody's life is in danger."" New York City The NYPD on Wednesday dispersed the last remaining Black Lives Matter protesters outside City Hall. The process was peaceful and most left voluntarily, NYPD Commissioner of Operations Ray Spinella said. The nearly monthlong protest encampment started with protesters demanding that the NYPD be defunded. About a week into the protest, the city had already slashed $1 billion from the police budget, reallocating the funds to other departments.  Boise, Idaho  Protests in downtown Boise on Tuesday were mostly peaceful, with only two people arrested for hopping barricades into a police-only area, CNN affiliate KBOI reported. It helped that Black Lives Matter held its rally at Boise State University, while counter-protesters gathered in front of City Hall. Later in the evening, a small group of BLM protesters also gathered at City Hall, but were kept on the other side of the street by police. Denver, Colorado  Black Lives Matter protesters clashed with law enforcement supporters during rallies on Sunday at Civic Center Park in Denver, CNN affiliate KMGH TV reported.  Police said they used pepper balls and pepper spray to disperse the larger BLM contingent.  Ron MacLachlan, founder of Pro Police Rally Colorado, told the station its members were standing ""with our men and women in law enforcement. Without them, we are in chaos and anarchy."" Counter-protesters with pots and pans, whistles and small sirens crashed the event and attempted to drown out the speakers, the station reported.  Scuffles erupted before police moved in to disperse the crowds.  Los Gatos, California About 100 demonstrators marched in the town of Los Gatos in Northern California on Sunday, CNN affiliate KGO reported.  The Black Lives Matter march, attended by a small group of counter demonstrators, was largely peaceful and caused backed up traffic on Highway 17, the station reported.  Louisville, Kentucky Black Lives Matter demonstrators have not only demanded justice in Floyd's name but also in the name of countless other Black lives cut short, including Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and Elijah McClain. Taylor, a 26-year-old EMT, was shot multiple times after police broke down the door to her apartment while executing a nighttime, no-knock warrant in a narcotics investigation on March 13. One group of protesters in Louisville has sought to reenergize the movement with a hunger strike that started at noon Monday, CNN affiliate WAVE reported.   ""We just want justice; however that is going to look and whatever the outcome,"" hunger striker Amira Bryant told the station. The four hunger strikers will only drink water and supplements, with a medic checking on them, according to the station. Over the weekend, protesters were arrested during a sit-in on the lawn of Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron, CNN affiliate WLKY reported.  The protesters called for justice in Taylor's case and warned of more events to come.  Roseville, Minnesota The theft of Black Lives Matter signs in Roseville, Minnesota, led to a rally on Sunday at Evergreen Park, CNN affiliate WCCO TV reported.  The Roseville Rejects Racism rally was organized after police released surveillance camera photos last week of a man and a woman in a truck stealing the signs in June.  Dead racoons were also left in the neighborhood, including one nailed to a utility police, the station reported.   Saginaw, Michigan  Black Lives Matter held a rally on Saturday on the front porch of Regina and Donald Simon, who say there were victims of a hate crime after a noose was put inside their vehicle, CNN affiliate WNEM reported.  The rally has encouraged the couple to continue to speak out against racial injustices within their community. ""You know that this isn't just going to be another rally, another march,"" Regina said. ""I've got good plans."" 'Strike for Black Lives' in 100 cities As part of the larger protest movement against systemic racism, thousands of essential workers walked off their jobs on Monday in more than 100 US cities in a call for higher wages, health care benefits and paid sick leave and the right to unionize.  Known as the Strike for Black Lives, the day involved Black and Brown fast food workers, home health aides, janitors, and others in industries where Black workers are disproportionately represented. The protest included a call for workers to walk away from their jobs for eight minutes and 46 seconds — the amount of time that a Minneapolis police officer suffocated Floyd in late May."," Black Lives Matter protests across America continue nearly 2 months after George Floyd's death. The NYPD has said it will not release the names of the officers involved in the incident. CNN has reached out to the NYPD for a comment. The demonstrations have been largely peaceful so far. But there have been reports of clashes between police and protesters, as well as a number of deaths.
 The shooting death of Floyd, a Black man, sparked protests across the country. But a grand jury in Miami-Dade County declined to indict the officers involved. The decision came after prosecutors failed to find probable cause to charge them with first-degree murder. The city of Miami-Dade County also declined to hold an investigation into the death. ""The fact that there was no grand jury means that the officers were not indicted,"" Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in a statement Tuesday. ""But they were held accountable anyway. This is a key part of the justice system that has been abused for far too long and must be reformed."" Floyd was shot on August 9, 2016, after police responded to a call about a man, who they said was armed, who was hiding in a backyard. The officers saw Floyd, who was running, and shot him multiple times, according to the attorney. ""He was just standing there, still in his shirt, still in his pants,"" the attorney said. ""They shot him because he was a threat."" The officers were cleared of any wrongdoing, but a grand jury in Miami-Dade County declined to indict them. ""The failure to indict these officers is a stark reminder of how much work still remains to make sure that our criminal justice system serves all of our citizens fairly and effectively,"" Lynch said. ""This failure to indict them is not the answer. It is a responsibility that we all must take on."" Protests continue Across the country, protests continued for the second night in the aftermath of Floyd's death. Demonstrators carried signs and carried a few messages. The grand jury in Miami-Dade declined to indict the officers.
 ""The grand jury was not unanimous in its decision, but it did reach the conclusion that the officers' actions were objectively reasonable under the circumstances presented to the grand jury,"" said Mark Jamar, the prosecutor in the case. ""The officers' actions were consistent with their training and the criminal code of the state of Florida,"" he said. ""The officers' actions were also consistent with the standards of care and professionalism expected of them by the law enforcement community. The actions of the grand jury were supported by the evidence presented at the trial."" In a statement, the attorney general said the decision ""is a strong rebuke of the actions of the grand jury, which failed to reach its verdict in the killing of George Floyd."" Floyd was shot by two Miami police officers on July 5, 2016, in the back as he lay dying in a police chokehold. One of the officers, Raphael Leal, was fired after he was charged with second-degree murder. The other officer, Dustin Schwarze, was acquitted. Schwarze was also charged with obstruction of justice. The officers were acquitted in a disciplinary trial earlier this year. The attorneys for the officers said the actions of the grand jury were unreasonable. ""The grand jury was empaneled to evaluate the evidence and to reach a determination in the matter of whether the officers acted within the law,"" the attorneys said in a statement. ""The officers' actions were objectively reasonable under the circumstances presented to the grand jury. The officers' actions were consistent with the standards of care and professionalism expected of them by the law enforcement community."" ""It is unfortunate that the grand jury failed to reach a verdict, but the fact that no verdict was reached in this trial does not mean that the officers were not guilty of any wrongdoing,"" the attorneys said. The officers were acquitted of any wrongdoing in a second-degree murder trial. The grand jury was empaneled to evaluate evidence and to reach a determination in the matter of whether the officers acted within the law. The officers' actions were objectively reasonable under the circumstances presented to the grand jury, said the attorneys. The officers' actions were consistent with the standards of care and professionalism expected of them by the law enforcement community. ""No one can take away the fact that George Floyd was a black man, but the fact that no verdict was reached in this trial does not mean that the officers were not guilty of any wrongdoing,"" said attorney Mark O'Mara. ""And it is equally important to point out that the grand jury was empaneled to evaluate evidence and to reach a determination in the matter of whether the officers acted within the law. ""The fact that no verdict was reached in this trial does not mean that the officers were not guilty of any wrongdoing,"" O'Mara said. The officers' actions were unreasonable, but not illegal, police said. ""Officer Schwarze acted in a lawful manner to restrain Floyd. Officer Leal followed protocol and followed his training to render aid. The actions of the officers were reasonable under the circumstances presented",1023

Nicoletti was one of the police officers to respond to the scene.  CNN has attempted to reach Nicoletti for comment. ""The complaint alleges that Officer Nicoletti broke the laws he was sworn to uphold and that his actions interfered with Philadelphians' and Americans' peaceful exercise of their sacred constitutional rights of free speech and assembly,"" District Attorney Larry Krasner said in a statement. Video and photo evidence show Nicoletti carrying a pepper spray can as he approaches three protesters who were sitting or kneeling on the interstate, according to the district attorney's office. The DA's statement alleges that without provocation, Nicoletti sprayed pepper spray in the faces of two protesters as they kneeled, pulling down the goggles one wore to spray her in the face. He also ""grabbed and violently threw"" a third protester who had been sitting ""hunched over"" to protect his face and then continually sprayed him, the DA's statement said. ""Unable to see due to the (pepper) spray, the protester swung at the officer, without contact,"" the statement said. ""The protestor was left on his feet in close proximity to moving traffic on the other side of 676, unable to see."" A fourth protester standing nearby was not sprayed. None of the protesters were arrested, according to the district attorney's office. Video shared online prompted the Philadelphia Police Department Internal Affairs Division to open an investigation and refer information regarding Nicoletti's alleged use of force to the District Attorney's Office (DAO) Special Investigations Unit on June 24, the DA's office said. In a statement, the president of the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police Lodge #5 criticized the district attorney's decision to charge the officer. ""Krasner refuses to hold unlawful protesters accountable, those who set fire and looted our great city. ... His top priority is to push his anti-police agenda,"" John McNesby said. ""This double-standard of justice is unacceptable to our brave police officers who work tirelessly to keep our city safe."" McNesby said they will provide ""an appropriate defense"" for  Nicoletti. CNN has also reached out to the Philadelphia Police Department for comment but has not heard back. The district attorney's office declined to provide charging documents, citing the active investigation.  Nicoletti is one of several officers to be charged by prosecutors around the country for their actions during protests.  On Monday, an officer in Detroit was charged with three counts of felonious assault in connection with the shooting of three photojournalists with rubber pellets during a May protest. And last month, Philadelphia Police Staff Inspector Joseph Bologna was seen on cell phone video appearing to strike a Temple University student in the back of the head during a protest. Bologna surrendered, according to a public relations representative working with the police union, and faced multiple assault charges."," Philadelphia police officer charged for pepper spraying Black Lives Matter protesters, prosecutors say. The incident happened when a group of police officers tried to arrest the group outside a McDonald's. Video of the incident shows the officers' guns and shields flying. That officer, Derek Chauvin, was not charged with any crime. His attorney, Ben Crump, said he believes his client acted within the law. ""This officer was not trying to injure anybody,"" Crump said. ""He acted within the law. He was a professional, and he was very professional."" Video shows two officers handcuff protesters The video shows two officers with guns at the scene.

Martin Luther King Jr. has been the subject of protests and protests of its own. The Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network has been organizing protests since Gray's death and has organized marches, sit-ins and protests in the past month.

The latest incident occurred Saturday afternoon when two women from Staten Island, ages 39 and 29, were arrested after they were seen pouring paint on the mural, the department said. When an officer attempted to approach one of the women, the officer slipped and injured his head and arm. He was taken to Bellevue Hospital and is in stable condition, the NYPD said. The two women were charged with criminal mischief and were released with desk appearance tickets, according to the NYPD.  The mural was first vandalized Monday when an unnamed suspect dumped red paint on the V in ""Lives."" The department said it was investigating the vandalism.  On Friday, surveillance video captured three individuals ""pouring and smearing paint on the mural and one female spreading flyers at the scene,"" according to the NYPD.  When police arrived, they arrested four people who had blue paint on their hands and clothing. Two women, ages 25 and 39, and a 44-year-old man, all from New York City, were charged with criminal mischief and released. A 64-year-old woman was issued a criminal court summons for illegally posting flyers, according to the police. Police did not say what was on the flyer. New York City's mural, similar to the one commissioned by Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser, was painted on Fifth Avenue in front of Trump Tower earlier this month. The building is home to the Trump Organization's headquarters. President Donald Trump called the words ""Black Lives Matter"" a ""symbol of hate"" and sharply criticized de Blasio for ""denigrating"" the area in front of Trump Tower. The mayor responded by saying the city was ""liberating"" and ""uplifting Fifth Avenue"" by painting the mural."," Black Lives Matter mural outside Trump Tower vandalized three times in one week. The city is working with the NYPD, the Secret Service, the US Secret Service, the Bronx Defenders, the NYC Police Department and the US Attorney's Office to determine who is responsible for the vandalism. The mural, which depicts a woman holding a gun, was spray-painted in the middle of the street where protesters gathered on Wednesday, the day after Trump's inauguration. The mural has been spray-painted with the words, ""Trump is Not Welcome"" and ""No Trump, No KKK, No fascist USA."" It was spray-painted on the building's facade and on the side of the building where protesters were housed. The graffiti reads, ""You are not welcome in our city."" NYPD officials said the vandalism is being investigated as a hate crime.

The district attorney's office says Osuna made a U-turn, got out of the car, pulled out a loaded revolver and pointed it at the bystander. ""He rolled by us and yelled at everybody and flipped us off, so I got on my skateboard just kinda followed him to get the plates. He made a U-turn, came back at me and pointed a gun in my face, said  'You want to do something?' That's it, a cop was behind him, immediately pulled him over, thank God,"" a witness at the scene told CNN affiliate KGO. Officers from the Martinez Police Department stopped Osuna and found the gun -- not registered to him -- in his car, the DA's office said. CNN affiliate KGO recorded video of the arrest. Contra Costa County District Attorney spokesman Scott Alonso confirmed to CNN the man seen in the video is indeed Osuna. He is charged with unlawful firearm activity and possessing a firearm not registered to him, both felonies, as well as a misdemeanor of exhibiting a concealed weapon in public. He could face up to three years in custody if found guilty.  CNN was unable to locate contact information for Osuna. The DA's office did not know if the man had an attorney. Osuna will be sent a notice to appear in court, Alonso said. Two other people, in a separate incident, are facing a hate crime charge and multiple misdemeanor charges for allegedly defacing that same mural during the July 4 holiday weekend. A woman was captured on video painting over the yellow-lettered mural with black paint while a man wearing a red Trump shirt that read ""Four more years"" filmed."," Man charged for allegedly pulling gun on Black Lives Matter mural bystander: 'You're going to jail' The court heard that the man, who is white, pulled a gun from his waistband and pointed it at the mural. He was not wearing a mask and was not carrying a weapon.  The judge then read out the man's sentence: three years in prison. He was also ordered to pay $3,000 in fines and costs. The incident happened when demonstrators blocked a major highway and tried to get cars off the road. Some people were injured, but police said the majority of the people were not.  ""This is going to be a part of your life for the rest of your life,"" the judge told the man. ""You're going to jail."" The man, who has not been identified, was found guilty of two counts of second-degree assault, a class B felony.

The protest began after the death of George Floyd, a black man who died last month after a police officer placed a chokehold on him. Protests were also held in several other US cities. The judge sentenced the man to five years in prison, suspended for five years, for violating his probation. Floyd was shot on July 5, 2016, by a Minneapolis police officer. He was unarmed when he was shot, but his death spurred protests across the US and beyond. Demonstrators chanted ""no justice, no peace"" and ""black lives matter.""

29,https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/10/us/jackie-lacey-la-da-black-lives-matter/index.html, Black Lives Matter's surprising target: Los Angeles County's first Black district attorney,"   ""Jackie Lacey must go! Jackie Lacey will go!"" Their mission has intensified in the wake of George Floyd's death and resulting nationwide protests. But unlike other Black Lives Matter targets -- including police brutality often at the hands of White officers -- their aim is on Los Angeles County's first Black and female district attorney, a homegrown prosecutor raised in South L.A. ""They think they're going to sweep all this sh*t under the rug like it never happened,"" shouted Fouzia Almarou, the mother of Kenneth Ross, Jr., who was shot dead by a Gardena police officer in 2018.   ""I'm here standing tall!"" Almarou yelled from a stage as she turned around to hurl expletives toward the Los Angeles County Hall of Justice, which houses the office of District Attorney Jackie Lacey. Her office had cleared the Gardena police officer of wrongdoing and ruled the shooting was justified.   One after another, nearly a dozen parents of dead children took to the microphone to blame Lacey, a Democrat, for what they see as an unwillingness to prosecute police officers.   ""Killer cops ain't funny!"" the crowd chanted in unison. ""Bye Jackie 2020!""   ""It's surreal,"" Lacey said of the weekly protests against her. ""It's almost like an out-of-body experience.""   In her first in-depth interview since Black Lives Matter stepped up its campaign to oust her, Lacey tells CNN she has more in common with protesters than they realize, and that in many of these cases, she's handcuffed by the law.   ""While you may look at a shooting by an officer and say, 'Oh, they could have shot him in the leg, they didn't have to respond that way,' that's not the test under California law,"" Lacey said. ""The test is when somebody's life is in danger.""   Still, the pressure on Lacey since George Floyd's death in Minneapolis has been unrelenting. So much so, that Burbank Congressman Adam Schiff, a high-profile Democrat, pulled his support for her, tweeting that his endorsement of Lacey a year ago no longer ""has the same meaning.""   ""I don't know why he pulled his support, but I have heard from electeds that they're being threatened via emails,"" Lacey said. ""People are showing up at electeds' houses late at night, protesting them.""   It happened to Lacey, too. But on that early morning, protesters wound up at gunpoint.   Protestors take their grievances to Lacey's house   It was still dark when Melina Abdullah led a group of protesters to Lacey's home on an early morning in March. It was a bold move, but the co-founder of Black Lives Matter L.A. felt she had little choice. ""We've been standing in front of her office, demanding that she meet with us for two and a half years and she refused to come out,"" Abdullah said. ""What alternative is there?""   Lacey said she has offered to meet in smaller groups after an early town hall-style meeting led to shouting.   ""When it's a large group, there's no dialogue; it's you yelling at me and hoping that I'll react poorly,"" Lacey said, noting that people film the exchanges with their cell phones.    That ""caught on camera"" moment, however, played out at her home, only that it was her husband on the video.   ""Good morning"" Abdullah said to David Lacey, who was pointing a gun at her and others.   ""Get off of my porch!"" he replied sternly.   ""Are you going to shoot me?"" Abdullah asked.   ""I will shoot you, get off of my porch!"" David Lacey said.   ""I don't care who you are, get off of my porch!"" he replied sternly.   ""Can you tell Jackie Lacey that we're here?"" Abdullah replied.   ""I don't care who you are, get off of my porch right now! We're calling the police right now,"" David Lacey said as he closed the door.   Lacey said she didn't know her husband was going to the door, and that the moment felt like ""utter chaos.""   ""We were both asleep and I just called 911, I didn't know what was about to happen,"" Lacey said. ""As district attorney, you realize that a lot of people may want to... do away with you because you're prosecuting them.""   At a press conference later that day, Lacey apologized on behalf of her family. She told CNN that coming to her home ""crossed the line.""    ""Creating a situation where someone thinks that they're about to be harmed, I don't think that helps your cause at all,"" Lacey said.   But Abdullah disagrees, saying ""people have been going to elected officials' houses for decades,"" and that it is all in the quest for social change. ""She doesn't get to hide just because she lives out in kind of suburbia,"" Abdullah said, arguing that public officials give up some of their privacy when they become public servants.   The fundamental disagreement over this issue is indicative of the broader chasm between Lacey's approach to her job and the expectations of protesters. They want stark change to correct what they see as generations of pain brought on by a broken criminal justice system that victimizes people of color.  Lacey doesn't disagree with that, she says, but she views change as something that can occur by fixing the criminal justice system, not dismantling it.   ""If you're talking about redistributing funds, I absolutely agree with that,"" Lacey said of her view on defunding the police.  ""I've advocated for mental health funds to go to communities of color since 2013. I've been advocating for treatment of drug addiction for a long time. But if you're talking about, let's just take all the police out of our community and if a crime happens, just let someone else respond, I just don't think that's realistic.""   While other politicians, including Adam Schiff, marched with protesters in the wake of George Floyd's death, Lacey's refusal to pick up a bullhorn has created the appearance that she hasn't laid bare her true allegiance. Black Lives Matter views her ambitions as ""narrow,"" ineffective and favoring the police. ""We wanted to be open to thinking about how can we allow her to be a more progressive district attorney and act in the interests of Black people as a whole,"" Abdullah said of their initial approach to Lacey. ""When you have somebody who is Black, it doesn't always mean they carry the interests of all Black people.""   ""They're treating me like 'the man,'"" Lacey said. ""But if they only knew that I'm the girl from the neighborhood."" From South L.A. to a seat of power   Lacey grew up in the Crenshaw district of South Los Angeles, born to parents who moved from the South.   ""They talked to me at an early age about Jim Crow and racism,"" she recalled.  A graduate of the University of Southern California Law School, her seminal case as a prosecutor was tried in front of famed judge Lance Ito -- an early use of L.A. County's hate crimes law that led to convictions for the beating death of a homeless man.   ""I actually went to law school to figure out how I could help people who didn't know their rights and didn't know the law,"" Lacey said.   Becoming L.A.'s first Black DA since the office was formed in 1850 seemed like a win for the community when Lacey took office in 2012.   ""I get in here and the most vocal group who wants to take me out is a group known as Black Lives Matter,"" Lacey said.   It is opposition the group says is necessary given the current climate.   ""As a Black woman, I would rather be celebrating other Black women, and I do,"" Abdullah said. ""My allegiance is to Black people, not to an individual Black person who wouldn't mind selling us out.""   Lacey has a hard time rationalizing that approach. Now 63, she says her upbringing gives her a much different view of Los Angeles than that of younger protesters.   ""I remember when my parents' home was broken into and they put bars on the window,"" she said, adding that her top priority as a youth was ""just getting home safely"" on her walks to and from Dorsey High School.   ""People don't realize in the seventies and eighties how dangerous it was in Los Angeles,"" she said. ""I remember when (my parents) used to complain that police don't care about our neighborhood.""   That's why she doesn't take a poisonous view to the institution of policing, she said. But her opponents see her as catering to police, especially since as the district attorney of the largest jurisdiction in the nation, it is her job to potentially prosecute police officers who use excessive force.   Black Lives Matter has created ""Jackie Lacey's Seven Deadly Sins,"" a list of what they see as her most egregious affronts to the Black community. They include disproportionately pursuing the death penalty against defendants of color and relying on the testimony of corrupt cops. But number one on that list: Ed Buck, a Democratic political donor and a resident of West Hollywood.  'How many disadvantaged Black men have to die...?'   Buck, a White gay man, allegedly invited a Black man to his home for sex and plied him with drugs until his death. The case was fodder for rumor, until he was accused of doing it a second time. That's when activists began to question whether it was criminal.   ""How many disadvantaged Black men have to die before Jackie Lacey will prosecute this Democratic donor?"" they asked.   ""I didn't know him. He gave a minuscule amount to my campaign. I think a hundred dollars,"" Lacey said. ""We gave it back.""   Then it happened a third time, only this time the man escaped Buck's apartment and called police. Protesters outside Buck's home got their wish -- charges were filed against him, including for battery and administering methamphetamine. Federal charges of distributing meth were added later, for which Buck will face trial next year.   Lacey said she didn't cave to protesters; rather, it took that long for the evidence to fit the law.   ""When we got that third person who lived, then we were able to file a case,"" Lacey said, arguing that the first two cases were ambiguous.   ""It reminds me of the John Belushi story. There was a woman who supplied him with drugs, he overdosed, and people wanted the DA to charge her with a crime,"" Lacey said. ""Ed Buck is similar in the sense of here were men who used drugs that Ed Buck supplied, but we don't know whether he injected them or they injected themselves.""   That attention to legal detail offers insight into Lacey's methodical approach to her position. It also explains why Lacey and protesters are fractured over another topic: police shootings.  'No matter who you have in this job, they still have to follow California law'   Lacey and Black Lives Matter are so far off on the topic of police shootings in Los Angeles County that they can't even agree on how many there have been.   Black Lives Matter has compiled a list of more than 600 people killed by police since Lacey took office in 2012. Lacey puts the number at about 340.   Both sides agree either number is too many, but Lacey touts another figure she says must be considered: ""14 or 15 of those shootings"" involved citizens who were unarmed, she said.   ""I can't tell you how many times I'll look at a case on television and say, okay, this is coming my way. Let's see what it's about,"" Lacey said. ""And I open the book and I say, 'Oh, no one mentioned that the guy had a gun, or the woman had a knife.'""   According to an official tally by her office, Lacey has reviewed 252 fatal shootings through May 2020. One of those cases resulted in charges against an L.A. County sheriff's deputy. The rest were declined.   Lacey said that's because the law leaves her with little wiggle room when a citizen is armed and it can be argued the officer was in danger at the time they pulled the trigger.   ""No matter who you have in this job, they still have to follow California law,"" she said.   But Black Lives Matter points to Lacey's support from police unions as a reason to be suspicious, since unions are largely seen as an obstacle to effective police reform.    Lacey says she is generally pro-union, which makes her liked by more than just police. She boast nearly 20 endorsements from unions and trade associations, including the L.A. County Federation of Labor.    ""But they are not in here making the decisions,"" she argues.    Aside from shootings, Lacey said she has still filed charges against 200 police officers or sheriff's deputies for various other on and off-duty behaviors. And her long-stated goal has been to keep people from coming in contact with police, she said.   ""Why are police called out for a mental health crisis? Shouldn't that be a social worker?"" she asks. ""Why is someone called out if someone is homeless and trespassing? And what can we do to get more people off the streets to discourage people from committing crimes to reduce recidivism?""   Those statements may sound similar to those of protesters, but the gap appears too wide for ground to be made up before the November election.    ""Unless Jackie Lacey were willing to bring charges in all 609 cases of those who were killed by police, yeah, it's too late,"" Abdullah said. ""She has proven over the last seven years who she is."" 'My next term will be my last'   Black Lives Matter doesn't make endorsements, but their call to oust Lacey can only benefit Lacey's challenger, George Gascón. That's why it's ironic that he's a former Los Angeles police officer and assistant chief, and more recently San Francisco's district attorney.   But that doesn't mean he wouldn't face the same scrutiny as Lacey, since Black Lives Matter considers the system ripe for the ""over-criminalization of people of color and poor people.""    ""And so, no matter who occupies the office, there's going to be a problem with the office itself,"" Abdullah said.   Despite years of protests, Lacey still enjoys broad Democratic support and nearly won a third term outright, getting just shy of the 50% of votes needed to avoid a general election.   But that was before George Floyd.    L.A. mayor Eric Garcetti has left his prior endorsement of Lacey ambiguous, conceding to a criminal justice reform website that ""it may be"" time for a change.   Though Gascón did not receive the endorsement of San Francisco mayor London Breed, where he served as DA, he has been backed by L.A. County's Democratic party and Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.   No matter how the election turns out, Lacey tells CNN ""my next term will be my last."" I think I'm going to care less about what people say and more about... how I want this book to end,"" she said. ""I want to see less juveniles in our... system, less people on the streets.   ""I don't want it to end like this, right?"" she continued. ""That as the first African American to hold this job, and protesters ran her out. That doesn't seem like a just ending."" Clarification: This story has been updated to include George Gascón's political endorsements."," Black Lives Matter's surprising target: Los Angeles County's first Black district attorney. ""They don't like that there's an independent prosecutor there that's looking into the conduct of the county,"" says Bekenstein, the University of South Carolina law professor. ""They're saying that there should be a prosecutor there. That's not a good thing. And they're not going to take it without saying that."" The most surprising and disturbing takeaway from the Washington Post's reporting on the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office is that the DA is not as aggressive as one might expect. In fact, the office is so dysfunctional it doesn't even have a budget. ""They don't have the resources to do their job, which is to hold the police accountable,"" says Michael Oppenheimer, a former director of the office who now runs the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. ""The DA is one of the most resistant to change in law enforcement."" It's no surprise that the DA has not fared well in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd. Oppenheimer says it's not that the office is corrupt or inept. ""They're not,"" he says. ""They're run by a bunch of people who have been in power for a long time. It's hard to see how they can fix themselves and get out of the way of the current system."" The reason the office hasn't been able to address the systemic racism that has led to the current situation is simple: It's a function of the people who run it, he says. ""The people who run the DA don't have a clue about the racism that is happening in their own office,"" Oppenheimer says. ""There is a racist component to it. It's not a rogue component. It's part of the system. It's part of the system. But the people who run the DA don't want to hear about it. They don't want to face it. They don't want to talk about it."" A DA who doesn't want to face it is a DA who is missing the point, says Bekenstein of the University of South Carolina. ""The point of an independent prosecutor is to hold the police accountable,"" he says. ""They're not going to fix themselves. The DA is not going to fix itself. The people who are running it are going to continue to get paid.""

""President Trump said we would be denigrating the luxury of Fifth Avenue.

President Donald Trump fumed at the plan after it was announced by city officials earlier this month.  He called the words ""Black Lives Matter"" a ""symbol of hate"" and suggested that police officers could block the work: ""Maybe our GREAT Police, who have been neutralized and scorned by a mayor who hates & disrespects them, won't let this symbol of hate be affixed to New York's greatest street. Spend this money fighting crime instead!"" CNN has reached out to the Trump Organization for comment. The mural marks the second time the words appeared in large letters outside one of Trump's homes; Washington's mayor had the term painted in large yellow letters on a street near the White House last month. The murals haven't pleased all Black Lives Matters supporters. After the debut of the Washington mural, the local chapter of the Black Lives Matter Global Network called the mural a ""performative distraction from real policy changes."" Black Lives Matter supporters have repeatedly called on local leaders to cut police budgets, which DC Mayor Muriel Bowser has cautioned against.  New York's city council this month voted to slash the NYPD budget, though even supporters of defunding the police on the council were not satisfied with the budget cuts, which still allowed for two police classes to join the force while freezing new hires in the Department of Education.

At the same time, the NYPD has declined to use its discretion in deciding which protests to prosecute, a senior NYPD official told CNN. ""As a result, the NYPD will not be able to cite or arrest demonstrators or their supporters at these protests,"" the official said. ""We will instead make arrests based on the direction of the NYPD Police Commissioner, who will take over from the President."" In New York City, where protests are being held for the second night in support of the movement, the NYPD's decision to not prosecute a protester caught on video kicking a police officer in the face was met with outrage from protesters. ""What kind of justice is that?"" one demonstrator asked. ""I don't see any kind of justice."" Protesters also criticized the NYPD for using tactical nukes to disperse the crowds.

""The WNBA is based on the principle of equal and fair treatment of all people and we, along with the teams and players, will continue to use our platforms to vigorously advocate for social justice,"" the league said in a statement. Loeffler is facing scrutiny in part because of a letter she wrote, obtained by CNN and first reported by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and ESPN, that warned the WNBA that ""to subscribe to a particular political agenda undermines the potential of the sport and sends a message of exclusion."" Loeffler co-owns the Dream, Atlanta's WNBA franchise, and is the wealthiest member of the Senate. Earlier this year, Loeffler came under fire for stock trades made before the coronavirus pandemic shuttered the economy.

Kelly Loeffler has not served as a Governor of the Atlanta Dream since October 2019 and is no longer involved in the day-to-day business of the team."" When asked for comment, a Dream spokesperson sent CNN a statement saying, ""The Atlanta Dream is not a political entity -- we are in the business of sports and entertainment. The Dream players and staff are focused on building a successful team on the court, winning games and creating a second-to-none fan experience."" Loeffler's letter came after the WNBA announced its plan to display ""Black Lives Matter"" prominently on its basketball courts. The league's players also plan to wear warmup shirts with the words ""Black Lives Matter"" displayed on the front and ""Say Her Name"" on the back, alongside Breonna Taylor's name. Former Atlanta Dream and University of Louisville player Angel McCoughtry spearheaded the campaign. In her letter, Loeffler urged WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert to cancel these plans, instead putting American flags on all uniforms and apparel. Loeffler, a staunch Trump supporter, is facing an intense reelection campaign against fellow Republican Doug Collins this November.  Former players and members of the WNBA Players Association immediately called for Loeffler's removal.

""The NBA has been slow to respond to the racial divide that's been bubbling in the wake of the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others, and while they may not be the first to use their platform to voice their concerns, it's clear that the league's response has been underwhelming,"" Lemon said.

The NBA has been a leader in social justice and civil rights for decades The NBA has been a leader in social justice and civil rights for decades, making the world a better place through its commitment to social justice. In 2017, the NBA and the National Basketball Association released the ""Black Lives Matter"" national platform, a groundbreaking initiative that saw the league championing of the Black Lives Matter movement and advocating for social justice and racial equality. The NBA's decision to remove itself from the platform and hold an all-day Black Lives Matter protest was a bold move, as the league had been a leader in the movement and was one of the first major sports leagues to publicly say that police officers who kill Black people need to be held accountable. In the words of the NBA's then-chairman and current president, David Stern, the league's decision to remove itself from the platform was a ""tactical mistake."" ""The NBA is a family and we want our players and employees to be able to be themselves, to have their own lives and to have their own opinions,"" Stern said.

But, she and her passenger both wanted to go right away -- so, they started to push, they pushed into the woman that was with me and when she pushed again both of us went on the vehicle,"" Stewart said in an interview with WRTV.

The demonstrations came in response to the killing of George Floyd, who was shot by police while protesting a death in custody. Floyd's death, which was captured on video, sparked protests across the US and around the world. Floyd's death was ruled a homicide, but Floyd's family sued the city of Dallas, which ultimately settled with Floyd's family for $5 million. CNN's Chris Cillizza reported that the protesters in Washington ""believed that the city could have handled this protest in a more responsible and thoughtful manner, by not deploying the National Guard and instead by allowing peaceful demonstrations to continue."" Demonstrations continued throughout the day. In New York City, thousands marched peacefully, carrying signs and pictures of Floyd. The protesters were mostly peaceful, though at times some hurled rocks and bottles at police. Police in New York City said there were no major incidents reported in New York, but that some protesters threw fireworks and bricks at officers.

""It appeared that the couple came to the mural with cans of paint and a roller with the specific purpose of vandalizing over the mural,"" Chief Sappal said in the statement. ""The community spent a considerable amount of time painting this mural only to have the suspects destroy it by dumping and rolling paint over part of the message."" During the incident, the unidentified woman stops painting to voice her concern suggesting these murals be kept in New York. ""This is not happening in my town,"" she said. As the video goes on, the woman off camera is heard referring to the White woman with the paint roller as Becky and the White man as Terry. ""Becky"" and ""Karen"" have come to symbolize a certain type of White woman, as has the name ""Chad"" for men.  The man in the red shirt repeatedly says, ""All lives matter"" throughout the video and a female bystander can be heard replying, ""Until Black lives matter, no lives matter."" The altercation goes on for about five minutes, with several bystanders interjecting and asking why this is happening. By the time police arrived at the scene, the man and the woman were gone, police said. Police are looking for a Nissan pickup truck with the word ""NICOLE"" painted in silver, which was provided by a witness. The man approached the vehicle while the video was being filmed. The case is being investigated and police are asking the public's help in identifying the man and the woman seen in the video. ""The community spent a considerable amount of time putting the mural together only to have it painted over in a hateful and senseless manner,"" Chief Sappal said. ""The City of Martinez values tolerance and the damage to the mural was divisive and hurtful."" The mural was repainted after the incident, according to CNN affiliate KPIX. The area was blocked off and the mural was surrounded by chalk images, as of Sunday afternoon, KPIX reported. In an unrelated incident Sunday, a man was arrested for shouting ""all lives matter"" and pulling a gun on a young man looking at the same Black Lives Matter mural, according to CNN affiliate KGO."," Police are looking for two White people who painted over a Black Lives Matter mural on a building in the city's Southside. The mural depicts a Black man being shot and killed by police. The two White people who painted the mural, who have not been identified, are also in the police custody. The two Black people who were inside the building at the time of the shooting were not injured. The mayor of Chicago has said that the White people who were involved in the shooting ""should be charged with their actions."" ""They have been charged with the murder of a Black man,"" Mayor Rahm Emanuel said. ""The police officers involved in this case are held to a higher standard. We expect them to be held accountable.""
 They were one of the first groups of Black people to protest in Chicago after the shooting death of 17-year-old Michael Brown. ""The Black Lives Matter movement is not a movement to protest,"" said Tanishia Crenshaw, a political activist and director of the Chicago chapter of the National Action Network. ""It is a movement to reclaim our city and reclaim our history."" The protests have seen demonstrators from all walks of life come together, from the LGBTQ community to the traditional political left. ""It's become a true community movement,"" said Crenshaw, who lives in Chicago and works in New York. ""It's become a platform for Black people to speak out and demand justice."" 'They don't want the police to be able to harm us' Chicago is a city of many things. It's a city of jobs, of commerce, of culture, of energy. But also of hate and violence and despair. Some say it's also become the playground for gangs and gangs of other criminals. ""They don't want the police to be able to harm us,"" said Wesley Lowery, a 19-year-old activist who lives in Chicago and was one of the first Black people to protest in the city. ""They don't want the police to be able to do what they do to us anymore. They don't want our kids to be coming out of high school and thinking about it when they get out of school, 'Oh, I'm going to be a police officer, that's going to get me killed. I'm not going to do that anymore. I'm going to protest and fight for something else.'""

Rothrock was the pastor of St. Elizabeth Seton Parish in Carmel. In a June 28 bulletin to his parish, Rothrock compared antifa and Black Lives Matter organizers to the Taliban in ""the obliteration of our history."" ""The brutal murder of a black man in police custody has sparked a landslide of reaction to the alleged systemic racism in America,"" Rothrock wrote.  ""On the heels of the Covid sequestration, the bottled-up tension of an isolated population has exploded into riots and demonstrations that we have not seen the like in fifty years. What would the great visionary leaders of the past be contributing to the discussion at this point in time?"" Rothrock asked in the bulletin. ""Would men like (Fredrick Douglass) and the Reverend King, both men of deep faith, be throwing bombs or even marching in the streets?"" Rothrock wrote. Asking who the ""real racists"" are, Rothrock said of protest organizers, ""They are wolves in wolves clothing."" ""They are maggots and parasites at best, feeding off the isolation of addictions and broken families,"" he wrote. ""Black Lives Matter, Antifa, and the other nefarious acolytes of their persuasion are not the friends or allies we have been led to believe,"" he wrote. ""They are serpents in the garden."" CNN was not able to find a phone number for Rothrock on Thursday to seek comment. On the same day he was suspended, Rothrock issued an apology in which he expressed surprise to the negative reaction his bulletin garnered. ""It was not my intention to offend anyone, and I am sorry that my words have caused hurt to anyone,"" he wrote.  Both the bulletin and Rothrock's apology have since been removed from St. Elizabeth Seton Parish's website.

Hundreds showed up.," ""We are the children, the mighty mighty children. Here to tell you, Black lives matter!"" hundreds of children chanted as they marched down neighborhood sidewalks in Kirkwood with their parents on Saturday.  Their voices might not have been as deep or statures as tall as other protesters, but their passion and energy were just as strong, thanks to the leadership of 8-year-old Nolan Davis, who organized the march.  ""I'm worried about Black people, like me, getting hurt. Some skin is like chocolate. Some is like vanilla. Some is mixed together like mine. But we're all people,"" Nolan Davis said through a megaphone at the start of Saturday's event.  ""Even though I'm a kid, it's important to speak my voice so people can hear me and know they can share their voice too, just like me.""  Nolan Davis got the idea to start his own protest after he and his mother went to a couple of other ones in the area.  ""Right after that, he asked me if he could have his own march so that he could let other people's voices be heard,"" his mother, Kristin Davis, told CNN.  So the two created a flyer for their ""Children's Black Lives Matter March"" and shared it to Facebook, asking families to meet at Kirkwood Park.  ""We thought that maybe 50 people would be there,"" Nolan Davis said. ""But there were like 700 people.""  Children of different races covered the sidewalks in chalk with phrases such as ""Stop Racism"" and ""Be Kind to Everyone."" They marched with posters in their hands that read among other things ""Black Children's Futures Matter.""  Nolan Davis led the way with his poster that read, ""Kids can make a change.""  He's just 8 years old, but he's already had the ""talk"" Despite being a child in elementary school, Nolan Davis has already been taught the ways he needs to act differently in society compared to his White friends, such as playing with water guns only in the backyard ""because you don't want it to get mistaken for something else"" or keeping the hood of his hoodie down, according to Kristin Davis.  As his White, adoptive mother, Kristin Davis acknowledged that she would never understand the fear that her Black son and daughter, five-year-old Caroline, would feel as they grow up. But she said she knew these talks were necessary to keep them safe.  ""We're preparing them for when they're older and taller and bigger. When they're not going to be perceived as cute little kids anymore,"" she said.  Nolan Davis said those rules make him feel angry.  ""I hate it,"" he said. ""I don't like how Black people have to feel scared when they're just walking down the street or going for a run.""  That's why he organized Saturday's protest, he said. He hopes it inspires more kids to do the same. ", An 8-year-old boy organized a Black Lives Matter march for kids. Hundreds showed up. It was a great day. But a lot of people said it was racist.

I was a victim of a mob that came through the gate,"" Mark McCloskey told CNN's Chris Cuomo Tuesday. He said it is ""ridiculous"" to consider him the face of opposition to the Black Lives Matter movement after the incident.  ""I didn't care what color they were. I didn't care what their motivation was,"" McCloskey said. ""I was frightened. I was assaulted."" Videos obtained by CNN show McCloskey, with a long rifle, and his wife, with a handgun, outside their St. Louis home around 7:30 p.m. Sunday. They are seen brandishing the weapons as demonstrators walked outside the home, protesting Mayor Lyda Krewson's decision to publish the names and addresses of people in favor of police reform. Portland Place, the private street where McCloskey lives, is near Krewson's home. McCloskey told CNN the mayor's house cannot be reached through his neighborhood and that hundreds of protesters broke through a private gate. He said the protesters threatened to kill him and his dogs and burn his house down. In two eyewitness videos, it appears the McCloskeys and protesters exchange words, but it's unclear what is said. McCloskey said his actions and those of his wife were justified.  ""My clients are completely behind and endorsed the message of BLM,"" McCloskey's attorney Albert S. Watkins said. ""What they are not capable of doing is embracing the abject utilization of that noble message that we all need to hear over and over and over again as a license to rape, rob, pillage bowl over all of our rights.""  Details of the protests contested McCloskey said he stopped seeing the gathering as a protest when he alleges the protesters broke through a wrought iron gate. Daniel Shular, a local reporter who took one of the videos obtained by CNN and said he watched the entire roughly 10-minute long incident unfold, said a door next to the gate at Portland Place was unlocked and protesters used that to cut through the neighborhood. In a video livestreamed on Facebook, the left gate door is held open by the first protesters that enter the private street. That video does not show how the door was first opened. However, a second Facebook Live video taken later shows the right gate door bent and broken on the ground. McCloskey exits the house 20 seconds later, and both videos show a heated, often profane back and forth between the couple and the protesters. Once through the gate, (the McCloskeys) advised the group that they were ""on a private street and trespassing and told them to leave,"" according to police. The couple told police the group began yelling obscenities and threatened to harm them. ""When the victims observed multiple subjects who were armed, they then armed themselves and contacted police,"" states the report. Shular recounted to CNN that he did see some armed people at the protest but that ""no one drew their guns on the people from the house."" The St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department told CNN it is investigating the incident. Circuit Attorney for the city Kimberly M. Gardner told CNN in a statement that she was alarmed by the events and her office is investigating. ""We must protect the right to peacefully protest, and any attempt to chill it through intimidation or threat of deadly force will not be tolerated,"" she said in her statement. ""Make no mistake: we will not tolerate the use of force against those exercising their First Amendment rights, and will use the full power of Missouri law to hold people accountable."" What led up to the protests The protesters passing through Portland Place were headed to Krewson's house, bypassing nearby road closures that blocked access to the mayor's home. They were spurred by her reading the names and addresses of people asking for police reform. The names and home addresses she read were submitted as part of public comments to the St. Louis County Council. Friday, the mayor apologized on Twitter, saying she didn't mean to hurt anyone. ""I'd like to apologize for identifying individuals who presented letters to me at City Hall today. This was during one of my Facebook updates as I was answering routine questions,"" Krewson said in a tweet. ""Never did I intend to harm anyone or cause distress. The update is removed and again, I apologize."" CNN has reached out to the St. Louis mayor and protest organizers about the incident but has not yet received a response."," St. Louis homeowner who pointed weapon at protesters says he 'was a victim of a mob' and doesn't oppose Black Lives Matter protests. ""I don't feel safe. I'm a victim of a mob. I'm a victim of a Black Lives Matter protest. They're coming to get me. They're going to make me look like a criminal,"" he said.

43,https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/25/us/hijab-removed-booking-photo-black-lives-matter-trnd/index.html, A Muslim woman says her headscarf was forcibly removed from her head for a booking photo after being arrested at a Black Lives Matter protest," Alaa Massri was arrested at a protest June 10, according to the Miami Police Department, and charged with battery, resisting an officer with violence and disorderly conduct. After her arrest, Massri was taken to the Miami-Dade Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center, where she says she was asked to remove her hijab for a booking photograph, her lawyer Khurrum Wahid told CNN. Muslim women who choose to wear the headscarf do not take it off in front of men outside of their immediate families.  After advising the officers that the hijab is a part of her religious beliefs and she did not wish to be photographed without it on, it was forcibly removed from her head, Wahid said. She was not allowed to put her hijab back on for what she estimated to be around seven hours. Miami-Dade County Corrections and Rehabilitation, the agency responsible for booking and mugshots, did not respond to CNN's repeated requests for comment. Massri's booking photo, which showed her without her hijab, was then distributed to several news outlets and began circulating on social media, according to Wahid. ""The damage from that cannot be undone,"" Wahid told CNN. ""That photograph is out there forever. This was a humiliating experience for her. Not just the arrest, but that her religious rights were violated."" Wahid filed an inquiry to the Miami-Dade County Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation's legal department, seeking additional information about what happened and the names of the officers involved, but has not received a response, he said Tuesday. ""I'm hoping that they respond to our request, but if they do not we will escalate it beyond basic communications,"" Wahid told CNN. ""We've also made an inquiry with their legal department."" 'They consciously took away her rights' After her hijab was removed for the booking photo, Massri said, she was made to spend hours without her hijab in the presence of multiple men. This ""completely disrespect(ed) her way of life,"" reads a Change.org petition started by Massri a week ago. ""They consciously took away her rights to be a woman practicing Islam and spread an image she never thought would be out in the world."" The petition, which has been signed by more than 125,000 people by Tuesday night, asks for all charges against Massri to be dropped, for her mugshot to be ""taken down,"" and for the officers involved to be investigated. According to the Miami-Dade County Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, there are policies in place to protect people who practice religious beliefs. ""Arrestees who claim or appear to be of a particular faith are allowed to keep their head covering once it has been searched for contraband and the booking photograph has been taken,"" a spokesperson for Miami-Dade Corrections said in a statement to CNN affiliate WSVN.  ""We are committed to ensuring that individuals' faith-based beliefs and practices are respected and will review this incident to ensure compliance with our policies and this commitment."" However, Massri was not searched in a private room and the hijab was forcibly removed from her head while men were present, a violation of both her privacy and religious freedoms, according to Wahid.  ""They should have allowed her to keep her hijab on,"" Wahid said. ""They can easily do a search in a private room with a same-sex officer. There is absolutely no reason not to give her back her hijab after the search or there to be a booking photo without her hijab on. Either the officers ignored the policy in place or the policy is simply not strong enough."" Forcibly removing the hijab from her head was a ""complete disregard"" of a central part of her faith and could also be a legal violation, said Omar Saleh, a lawyer for the Council of American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), which has not been asked to assist in Massri's case. ""The arrest which results in the removal of a hijab during booking and prolonged removal of the hijab is a legal issue and severe violation, not just of the 1st and 14th Amendment, but also the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act,"" Saleh told CNN. ""Forcing a woman to remove her hijab causes humiliation, mental anguish and distress."" In 2018, the New York Police Department was ordered to pay $180,000 to three Muslim women after forcing them to remove their hijabs for booking photos, the New York Daily News reported. Another Minnesota woman received a $120,000 settlement in 2019 after she was forced to remove her hijab following an arrest over a traffic violation, The Star Tribune reported. The jail also implemented new rules regarding proper procedures on how to accommodate inmates with religious headwear.  Linda Sarsour, a political activist and Muslim woman in New York who also wears a hijab, has been arrested during protests several times. Sarsour said an officer once tried to force her to take off her hijab during the booking process, but she said it seemed mainly to be an issue of a lack of proper training. ""For effective police work, it doesn't make sense to ask Muslim women to take off their hijabs. For every way we are identified by the government, whether it's our passports, driver's license, Costco cards, college ID, you name it, this is how we look all the time in public,"" Sarsour told CNN. ""It's illogical for police departments to want Muslim women to take off their hijab because that is not the way we show up in the world. The idea of the database is that the mugshot goes in the database, and if you commit a crime again that database is used to identify you. So how are you going to identify us if the way we show up in your database is not how we show up in the rest of the world?"" To force a Muslim woman to remove her hijab for a photo is ""dehumanizing and humiliating and strips you of your dignity,"" she added. The death of George Floyd, a handcuffed Black man, while in Minneapolis police custody has triggered protests across the country, including the protest where Massri was arrested along with six others. At one point during the protest, police attempted to ""form a skirmish line"" to block protesters from taking over the street, according to an arrest affidavit obtained by CNN. At the time of her arrest, Massri, who says she was rushing to help an injured protester, was confronted by multiple police in riot gear, she said in the petition. The incident report also alleges that Massri hit an officer ""in the right bicep with a closed fist"" after he ""grabbed"" her to escort her out of the street after she refused orders to get out of the road. Massri was charged with battery, resisting an officer with violence and disorderly conduct.  ""The officer is incorrect. If she unintentionally waved her hand and it made contact, that is not a crime,"" Wahid said. ""We are defending her criminal charges, which we strongly believe she committed no battery on a police office and did not intentionally strike the officer. I strongly believe she will be exonerated of that."" Massri was released on $5,000 bond on June 11 and her arraignment hearing is set on July 10, her lawyer said."," A Muslim woman says her headscarf was forcibly removed from her head for a booking photo after being arrested at a Black Lives Matter protest. The headscarf was later returned. The protest, which was organized by the Council on American-Islamic Relations, turned violent. In one incident, a man punched a protester in the face, police said. But a group of Black Lives Matter protesters took to the streets to protest the beating. They were met by police in riot gear and tear gas. One person was arrested. Black Lives Matter protesters were joined by people of all ages, including some children, who demonstrated in the streets. It was one of the first protests I have seen with my own eyes. The protesters were mostly peaceful, but there were some tense exchanges with police. Some people were arrested.
 It was a quiet night, but it was still pretty cool. And there were some cool shots of it. The first day of protests was one of the coolest nights I've ever been to a protest. You know, like, the one where they had a helicopter hovering above the whole place and it was kinda cool. The other cool thing about the day was that the NYPD actually put out a statement saying that they will no longer be arresting people who block traffic on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. It was a huge deal. But mostly it was cool. The city was like a movie set. The streets were lit up with colors and sounds and glitter and sparkles and teddy bears and flamingos and balloons and a whole bunch of other stuff. There was even a little kid in a pink and white tank top who had some cool looking baseball capes on. It was pretty cool. Like, for real. So when I heard that the NYPD would no longer be arresting people who block traffic on Fifth Avenue, I thought, wow, cool, I'll bet my bottom dollar that that that's exactly what's going to happen. That's what happens when you've got the resources and the manpower. And I mean, if they actually do it, that means the NYPD is going to be able to arrest more people. They're going to be able to put more cops on the street. I mean, I'm not saying that's going to happen, but if they do it, it will definitely change the way the NYPD operates. They're going to have to figure out how to run a criminal justice system that works. They're going to have to figure out how to keep people safe. They're going to have to figure out how to deal with the mentally ill. There's going to be a lot of data that points to a change in that regard. And the NYPD is going to have to figure out how to get better at that. And I think there's going to be a lot of frustration. Because what they're going to do is they're going to have to really, really, really try to change. And they're going to have to really, really, really try to do it.
 It's hard to imagine that anything could be worse than the state's first-ever Confederate flag ban. But for the last month, the city's top cops have been out in full riot gear, waving Confederate flags and wearing body armor. That's exactly what happened last week, when officers in riot gear and helmets descended on the city's most populous city. And it's what happened last weekend, when the city's mayor called for the immediate reinstatement of its controversial controversial ""Don't Tread on Me"" law. And it's what happened last night, when a man was shot by a police officer in a park. ""I think the police are trying to protect themselves and their officers, and that's the wrong way to do it,"" said Cornel West, a professor and activist at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. ""When you do it the other way around, you're putting your officers in harm's way and it's going to create more of a problem, and it's going to take longer to get justice. And it's also going to hurt your feelings."" The gun debate: A fight over the Confederate flag
 The Confederate flag ban, which the city council voted unanimously to take action on Tuesday, was one of several controversial issues that came to a vote in the wake of the deadly violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. The city council voted unanimously to ban the flag, which was not a part of the city's official charter. ""I'm disappointed that the city council voted to ban the Confederate flag, but I'm equally frustrated that they voted to remove the flag from City Hall,"" Mayor Greg Fischer said. ""It is a symbol of hate and racism that we must never, ever allow to be displayed on our city."" Fischer said the city will put the flag back up. ""This flag ban will be enforced, and the flag will be put back up in City Hall,"" he said. ""This flag ban is a victory for our city, our community and our flag. It is a step in the right direction, but we have to do more",1023

In fact, researchers determined that social distancing behaviors actually went up after the protests -- as people tried to avoid the protests altogether. But obviously, these demonstrations caused a decrease in social distancing among actual protesters.  ""Our findings suggest that any direct decrease in social distancing among the subset of the population participating in the protests is more than offset by increasing social distancing behavior among others who may choose to shelter-at-home and circumvent public places while the protests are underway,"" the report reads. It's still possible that protests may have caused an increase in the spread of the virus among those who attended protests, according to the report.  Researchers also noted that the effect of protests on social distancing and stay-at-home orders may fade as the violence and scope of protests decline. As the protests begin to lessen or become less intense, non-protesters will feel safer leaving their homes. ""There are other possible explanations for our findings as well, such as avoiding travel outside the home due to additional traffic congestion or street closures, or due to lack of available activities from businesses closures near protest sites,"" the study reads.  Coronavirus continues to spread in the US The study comes as new data shows that more and more young people are testing positive for coronavirus, particularly in states that have opened back up. On Monday, Florida surpassed 100,000 total coronavirus cases, according to the the Florida Department of Health. In California, more than 35% of confirmed cases have been recorded in just the past two weeks, Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a news conference Monday. In Texas, people under 30 make up a majority of new coronavirus cases in several counties, said Gov. Greg Abbott last week. That increase in young infected people could be related to Memorial Day parties, visits to bars or other gatherings, he said.  Unlike Europe and Asia, the US has not been able to control the pandemic -- as cases continue to surge amid debates over wearing face masks and the need for social distancing. "," Black Lives Matter protests have not led to a spike in coronavirus cases, research says. Instead, the two trends have been linked to other factors. The first is that people are still getting tested. People may not be testing positive for coronavirus, but they are testing positive for other infectious diseases. And the first thing that people do when they test positive for coronavirus is to get tested for other infectious diseases, like tuberculosis. ""The more people are testing positive for coronavirus, the less likely they are to test positive for other infectious diseases,"" said Marlene Zuk, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Maryland and the co-author of ""Thrive: The Power of Networks to Make Change and Prosperity."" ""It's an ongoing downward spiral."" A 'power play' Between the protests and the coronavirus pandemic, the movement to reclaim the word ""Black"" and reclaim the city's name is being played out on a national scale. The National Football League has played host to ""Thrive"" concerts, which have featured Black players and coaches, and Black-led marches, protests and other events. The NFL is playing host to its own ""Thrive"" movie, which will feature Black and Brown actors playing the roles of scientists and leaders in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic.

The owner of the private property installed the surveillance camera near the banner that captured multiple people vandalizing and attempting to remove the sign, which was made out of large white letters spray-painted on  brown tarps. He posted the footage on social media. Detectives from Ventura County Sheriff's Office allegedly recognized one of the men in the footage damaging the sign as Darrin Stone, a sheriff's office employee who had been assigned as a service technician at the pre-trial detention facility in Ventura, a non-sworn position.  Stone was captured on the homeowner's video slashing the sign on June 13 and 19, the sheriff's office said. Stone was off-duty at the time of both incidents, and received a misdemeanor citation for vandalism and was placed on paid administrative leave. He could not be reached for comment. ""I'm deeply disappointed that one of our employees involved himself in this type of illegal activity, especially when this is an infringement on someone's First Amendment right to freedom of speech,"" said Sheriff Bill Ayub in a statement. ""We will not tolerate unlawful or unethical behavior by anyone employed by our agency. We hold our employees to the highest standards, and there will be consequences for this."" An investigative assistant in the Ventura County District Attorney's Office was also cited for vandalism allegedly being captured on video vandalizing the sign. The sheriff's office said on May 31, Craig Anderson cut down the BLM sign, noticed the homeowner's surveillance camera, and left the scene. District Attorney Greg Totten said Anderson was cited for misdemeanor vandalism and has resigned from his position in the office. ""Mr. Anderson has worked as a non-sworn investigative assistant with the District Attorney's office for approximately four months,"" Totten's office said. ""In accordance with District Attorney policy, the misdemeanor vandalism citation will be referred to the Attorney General's Office for all purposes due to Mr. Anderson's employment status. Mr. Anderson has resigned his employment with the District Attorney's office."" Attempts by CNN to reach Anderson for comment were unsuccessful.  A third man, Jeffrey Moore, was also arrested for allegedly defacing the sign on June 11. The sheriff's office said he was identified on the homeowner's video footage by the company name and phone number that was ""prominently displayed on his vehicle.""  CNN was unable to reach Moore for comment. Andy Meyers, the homeowner where the sign was erected, said his son, a college student, created it to show support for the Black Lives Matter movement. ""None of us expected it to be vandalized. But to have it defaced by people we've always taught him he's supposed to trust has been a terrible lesson to learn,"" Meyers told CNN. ""Black Lives Matter. Period. He put up a sign to support a movement. Ironically, their efforts to take it down have only led to more visibility for it."" Meyers said he and his son decided to install a security camera near the sign after someone attempted to take it down, capturing multiple acts of vandalism. ""We couldn't believe that someone would actually steal the sign,"" he said. ""So then we put up the cameras. And to see the hatred — one guy with a knife, one guy practically ripping our fence down, two separate guys with spray paint — it's sickening."" And while the situation has left him disheartened, Meyers said he was ""far more encouraged by the countless young adults who are becoming activists and agents for positive change, especially my son."" Despite the damage to the sign, Meyers said he was grateful to the sheriff's department for being forthcoming with the arrests. ""The sheriff's office does an amazing job — this is one of the safest communities in the US,"" he said. ""It's been so impressive that he stood up, identified one of the vandals as someone in his office, and acted on it immediately. That says so much.

 It was the first time since the shooting death of Michael Brown that the grand jury heard the case against the officers involved in his death. The two sides in the case, which was heard by a grand jury last week, will face off in court Thursday. The shooting of a unarmed black man by a white police officer sparked nationwide protests and debate over the use of force between police and minorities. Brown, a black man, was shot by an officer after allegedly trying to take his gun. His death led to a major police reform movement.
 The officers' attorneys argued that the city's use of deadly force policy requires them to shoot first. The grand jury will decide whether to indict the officers in the death of 18-year-old Tyrone ""T.Y."" Holloway. The officers are white, but their trial is being held separately from the prosecution. The grand jury is expected to hear testimony from as many as seven officers. But the identities of the other officers remain a mystery. The grand jury will also hear testimony from the officers' spouses, and possibly from other family members. ""This is a case that is going to be riveted on in the city of Ferguson,"" Ferguson Police Chief James Knowles III told reporters. ""It's going to be in the national spotlight. People are going to be talking about it. People are going to be watching."" The Ferguson grand jury will hear testimony from the family members of one of the officers, as well as from an expert witness. ""This is going to be a very, very tough case,"" Knowles said.

In the video, Deputy Cameron Kinsey runs toward the women when he realized they were in distress. The mother handed the limp child to Kinsey and after assessing the baby, the sheriff's department said he ""administered a mouth sweep with his finger and dislodged vomit.""  The baby began to breathe again to the relief of everyone there.  ""None of that other stuff matters,"" Kinsey said about everything taking place at the time. ""Just the baby."" Paramedics arrived and took the child to a nearby hospital where it was determined the boy had swallowed a coin, which had lodged in his throat and blocked his airway. Kinsey's finger sweep turned the coin sideways so the child was able to breathe again, the department said. "," A sheriff's deputy saved a baby from choking during a Black Lives Matter protest  ""I'm not going to lie,"" he said. ""I'm not going to say I was a hero, but I'm proud of the person that was there."" He was also proud of the officers who took the time to call paramedics to the scene. ""That was a heroic act on the part of the officers. That's what we expect from our police officers,"" he said. ""That's what we expect from the American police officer.""
 The officers' actions were criticized on social media and in the African-American community. Some people took to social media to express their outrage over the officers' actions and the incident's aftermath. Others said they didn't feel safe seeing police officers in the area. One black Facebook user posted a graphic video of a black teen being shot by a white police officer and said he felt like he was in danger. The officer is seen in the video lying on",181
51,https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/17/us/mlk-quote-removed-westchester-trnd/index.html, A family posted a Martin Luther King Jr. quote in honor of Black Lives Matter. Their town told them to take it down," Since Avisia Brown and her mother had multiple health issues and didn't feel safe going to protests, they decided to put several signs on their house in Westchester County, New York. The signs included a bedsheet hung across the front window with a quotation from Martin Luther King Jr. saying, ""Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."" But on Sunday, Brown and her husband Dan found a letter from the town of Eastchester between the porch and the side of their house, saying they had to remove the banner or face a fine. The letter, dated June 12, said the family had to take down the banner by the next day, or they could be fined up to a $1,000 per day or be imprisoned for up to a year. ""The letter seemed very shady, but I took down the sign and reached out to the town,"" said Brown, who lives in the house with her husband, their son Odin and her mother, Doreen Limato. ""I called the cellphone number on the letter, and I emailed him. They didn't call us back,"" she said.  Brown said that the town's director of building and planning eventually emailed them back, saying her message had been forwarded to the town attorney. But they haven't heard from anyone since then. In a neighborhood decorated with large banners for birthdays, graduations and in support of health care workers, Brown thinks that their sign was targeted because of the content. The town fully supports the content of the sign, said Town Supervisor Anthony S. Colavita, but the town has received multiple complaints about it and the town code doesn't permit banners on residential buildings. He told CNN that five other locations in the area were asked to take down banners, including a house with a Trump 2020 sign.  ""We had contacted them, the town attorney reach out to them four or five times and left his card there to work things out,"" Colavita said. He said that the letter was a last resort for the town.  But Brown said her family never received any warning from the town. Both Colavita and Brown say they have the phone records to prove their version of events.  Brown said she is especially frustrated because the letter citing the code includes language saying displays consisting of ""banners, pennants, flags, (except for the American Standard) ribbons, streamers, spinners, or similar moving, fluttering, or revolving devices"" are forbidden. If this is true, Brown said, then some of her neighbor's decorations wouldn't be allowed either. She asked several of her neighbors if they've gotten a similar letter, but they told her they haven't. Brown doesn't want to her neighbor's decorations taken down, but wants to be allowed to express her support for what she said is an important cause. Limato, who has lived in the neighborhood for more than 45 years, expressed disappointment at the town's request. They've had banners on their house regularly for the last 10 years and were never told to take them down, she said. ""I live in America, and I don't have free speech,"" she said. ""It's a very important issue."" When asked about why holiday banners of the same size were not asked to be taken down, Colavita said that holiday decorations are allowed since they are temporary.  Colavita told CNN the town board decided Tuesday night to review current sign regulations and will suspend enforcement of banners in the meantime. Brown said her family never intended for this situation to become an issue like this. ""I'm not doing this to tear the town apart, I was hoping to bring it together. As a town and a community, we are not doing enough for Black Lives Matter. We are not focusing equally on these communities as we can be as a community,"" said Brown."," A family posted a Martin Luther King Jr. quote in honor of Black Lives Matter.

""The Boy Scouts of America stands with Black families and the Black community because we believe that Black Lives Matter,"" the organization said in a letter on Scoutingwire, the organization's official blog. ""This is not a political issue; it is a human rights issue and one we all have a duty to address.""  Now, scouts must earn a diversity and inclusion merit badge to achieve the rank of Eagle Scout, the highest rank in the Boy Scouts program. The new badge will build on existing programs that require scouts to ""engage with other groups and cultures.""  The organization said it's banned the Confederate flag for nearly 30 years, but it'll review property names, events and insignia to ""ensure that symbols of oppression are not in use today or in the future.""  ""We will also continue to listen more, learn more and do more to promote a culture in which every person feels that they belong, are respected and are valued in Scouting, in their community and across America,"" the scouting organization said.  Boy Scouts address recent discrimination Boy Scouts didn't fully integrate until after the Civil Rights Act passed -- a few Southern Boy Scout councils held out until the 1970s -- but the organization made way for the first black troop in 1911. Those scouts were still met with racism, though: The organization defined black scouts as ""Special Troops"" based on their race and considered them less-than, according to the African American Registry, an education nonprofit.  Some of the scouting program's discriminatory policies remained in place until the last decade.  Until 2014, Boy Scouts of America banned gay children and teenagers from joining the program. One year later, the organization removed its ban on gay troop leaders and employees, though it still gives chartered organizations the right to deny adults positions based on their sexuality.  In 2019, girls were allowed to join Boy Scouts, one year after they were allowed into Cub Scouts, the scouting program for younger children.  Then, this year, the Boy Scouts of America filed for bankruptcy, and the hundreds of lawsuits it was fielding about accounts of sexual assault within the program are now on hold.  Court testimony released last year shows that over 7,800 former scout leaders are accused of sexually abusing 12,000 scouts over 72 years. "," Boy Scouts of America shows support for Black Lives Matter and will require some scouts to earn diversity badge. But it has been a long time since the organization has shown such a commitment to diversity and inclusion. In the past, the organization has taken a hard stance against such organizations as the KKK and Nazis, which it once called its ""favorite enemy."" In a recent statement, the organization said it was ""shocked"" by the violence in Charlottesville and said it will ""continue to work closely with local, state and federal authorities in their investigation of the events."" ""We stand by our core values and will not tolerate the kind of hate speech and violence that took place in Charlottesville,"" the statement said.
 In the early 1970s, the first of its kind, the Boy Scouts of America began allowing openly gay youth to join. The organization still uses a policy barring openly gay youth from leadership positions. It's not clear how many gay youth joined the organization in the 1970s. But the impact of the policy is clear today. In the early 1980s, the organization's Board of Directors voted to ban the ordination of gay youth. Today, the Boy Scouts of America is the only organization that bans openly gay youth from its ranks. The decision to ban gay youth from the organization has been met with protests, boycotts and even death threats. It's hard to imagine a more inclusive organization than the Boy Scouts of America, which has said it will ban gay youth from leadership positions. But the organization has not done that yet. The ban is expected to come into effect in 2019. Boy Scouts of America officials have said they plan to continue to ban gay youth. But there's growing support from groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and the Human Rights Campaign that want the organization to ban gay adults. The ACLU of Southern California released a statement this week saying it will file a lawsuit against the Boy Scouts of America later this year. The Human Rights Campaign says it will file a similar suit against the Boy Scouts of America later this year. Boy Scouts of America officials say they are considering other policies to protect against bullying and abuse. The organization also says it will ban the use of cookies",417

Their deaths are being investigated as homicides. Police arrested a suspect, Aaron Glee, 49, the Tallahassee Police Department said.   Salau was last seen on June 6. Earlier that day, she'd tweeted that she was sexually assaulted. Her friend Chynna Carney confirmed the Twitter account belonged to Salau.  The tweets said that Salau had left some belongings at a church where she was seeking shelter and a man who'd offered her a ride to recollect the items later molested her while she tried to sleep.  It's unclear whether Glee is the same man Salau reported had molested her. CNN has reached out to Tallahassee Police to confirm Salau's account of sexual assault and is waiting to hear back. Sims was a longtime AARP volunteer. Her family declined to comment on her death.  A 19-year-old activist and friend Salau had been Carney's friend since before high school, she said. The 19-year-old taught herself to sew, paint and design her own clothes. ""She had so many dreams and she never gave up,"" Carney said. But she'd endured a tremendous amount of pain, too; Carney described her as a sad person with the ""happiest soul."" And she was always a vocal supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement. ""When she started protesting with us, that was the happiest I've ever seen her,"" Carney said. Footage of Salau speaking at a protest in honor of Tony McDade, a trans man who was killed by Tallahassee police last month, has quickly traveled since her death. In the clip, she says he doesn't want to divide people, but unite them against police brutality committed against black Americans. ""At the end of the day, I cannot take my f*****g skin color off,"" Salau says in the clip. ""Everywhere I f*****g go, I am profiled whether I like it or not... So guess what? I'm gonna die by it. I'm going to die by my f*****g skin. You cannot take my f*****g blackness away from me.""  Her passion endeared her to Alina Amador, a photographer who frequently recruited Salau to model for her.  ""Her beauty was so radiant, and modeling for her was so effortless,"" she said. ""She was very calm and gentle.""  Carney said her friend's death has motivated her to fight for black women like Toyin.  ""I will never stop protesting,"" Carney said. ""I will fight for her and for black people and people of color 'til I'm dead."" "," Black Lives Matter activist found dead one week after she went missing in Florida. A new wave of racist violence in the US has been blamed on white supremacist groups and extremist groups like the Proud Boys. But what exactly is the ""alt-right"" and how did it get started?
 There's a lot of talk about the alt-right these days, and that's because there's a lot of hate speech and violence being spewed out of it. ""The alt-right is a loose confederation of white nationalists, neo-Nazis, and all-around racists, whose stated goals include the destruction of the mainstream conservative movement, the establishment of a white ethno-state, and the re-imaging of history to make their point,"" CNN's Don Lemon wrote this week. ""Their anti-immigration stance is sometimes described as 'America First.' They're also sometimes referred to as 'alt-right' or 'white nationalists.' Their hate speech and white nationalist propaganda have been credited with inspiring some of the most violent white supremacist groups in history."" The term has become a rallying cry for some Americans who see it as a counter-culture alternative to mainstream conservatism. The ""alt-right"" is the term used to describe those who identify with the ideas of the alt-right, but who also believe in free speech, white nationalism and the preservation of traditional American culture. It's often associated with violent extremist groups like the Proud Boys, whose leader, Joseph Lloyd, told CNN's Don Lemon that the term has become a ""dissident symbol."" ""The alt-right is a loose confederation of white nationalists, neo-Nazis, and all-around racists, whose stated goals include the destruction of the mainstream conservative movement, the establishment of a white ethno-state, and the re-imaging of history to make their point."" While the term has become associated with violent extremists, it's also used by people who are simply apolitical. That's why it has become so controversial. ""It's a term that I think has a lot of baggage,"" University of Maryland's Joseph P. O'Donnell told CNN's Don Lemon",418

""I had no idea I would propose at the protest,"" Young told CNN. ""But when we decided to go, I threw the ring in my bag along with protest gear. When things slowed down a bit, I made it seem like I was grabbing some water, pulled out the ring, and asked her to marry me."" Photographer Charles Crouch was at the protest in Raleigh on May 30 and captured the heartwarming moment in what he called ""divine timing."" After the proposal, he and the couple ended up becoming friends. Alston, 23, who is four months pregnant with the couple's first child, said she knew Young would find a bold way to propose to her. But when he did it at the protest, she was completely shocked -- and immediately said yes. ""I wasn't really expecting this, but I loved it. It was very sweet and memorable. I know I will remember the moment forever,"" Alston said. 'Black lives matter and black love matters' Alston and Young met in the summer of 2018 when they were working at a laser tag entertainment center, but it wasn't love at first sight. ""The first thing I said to her was, 'Oh my God, is that your voice, stop talking',"" Young laughed. ""And then we fell in love."" The proposal did more than solidify their love -- it connected them to their community and symbolized hope for the future, he said. The newly engaged couple were protesting police brutality and racial injustice, along with many others who've taken to the streets across the United States since May 25, when a Minneapolis police officer killed George Floyd, an unarmed black man, by kneeling on his neck. Young said he hopes the proposal brought something beautiful to an otherwise difficult and painful time. ""It's important for black people, people who look like Marjorie and I, to see images of black love amid everything that's going on and happening recently,"" he said. ""Black lives matter and black love matters because with our love we can heal each other and begin to address the trauma of being black in America."" After the sweet proposal, the two got back up and continued protesting, something they plan to keep doing until there is change."," He proposed to his girlfriend at a Black Lives Matter protest to celebrate black love. She was shocked, he said. ""She started crying. I didn't think she would be that open about it,"" he said. He said the cops didn't tell him what happened next. He was on the ground handcuffed and he felt ""violated,"" he said. He said he was unable to move his legs, so he was taken to the ground and told to stand up straight and not move. He was put in a chokehold and held down for about two minutes before being taken to the hospital. ""I was trying to get my legs up. I was trying to get my arms up. I was trying to get my head up. I was trying to get my arms up,"" he said. The police department has not responded to CNN's request for comment. The protests have spread nationwide, with demonstrations and demonstrations in the state capital of Raleigh.
 It was a harrowing glimpse into the mind of a young man who was watching the world through a glass darkly. ""I'm afraid that my world is ending,"" he told his girlfriend, who was in the audience. ""I'm afraid that I'm going to be alone forever. ... I'm afraid that my parents are going to kill me."" It was the first time in his life he felt fear, he said. ""I've never been afraid of anything in my life,"" he said. ""I've never been afraid of anything in my life."" A few hours after his girlfriend's death, he went to a police department to talk to the officers about what happened. He said he was told he couldn't talk about it with his girlfriend or his parents, and that if he did, they would kill him. He didn't want to be a danger to anyone, he said. The day after his girlfriend's death, he went to a homeless shelter in Raleigh and stayed with her family. He stayed with her for a few days, he said. ""She was my best friend. She was my everything.

The art along East Pine Street is near a police precinct left empty as demonstrators protesting the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis began occupying the area around it. Some protesters are now calling the area the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. Artists Takiyah Ward, Joey Nix, and Japhy White organized the painting and helped get the local artists on board.  Muralist and Mexican American Angelina Villalobos painted the ""A."" She told CNN that the artists found out about the project by word of mouth.  The Seattle native, her sister Claudia, her niece Gabba, and her stepdaughter Mercedes were all part of the painting, and even added something to make it extra special.  ""We put (my mom's ashes) in the paint color that is her favorite ... so she is specifically part of the letter A, but if anyone else used my paint she's a part of the whole thing,"" Villalobos said.  Her family takes the ashes with them wherever they go and leave some of her on their adventures.  ""This is something she would have been passionate about ... we still wanted her to be a part of it because we knew this was something that would have aligned with her goals, and with how she thought the world should be,"" she said.  Villalobos said it took a team of people to make the massive mural happen, and she was most proud that her teenage niece and stepdaughter were a part of its creation.  ""I'm so proud they were involved. In my work, it's vital that we engage youth and nurture their awareness of how they see themselves in relation to the rest of the world."" Garrett Padera took photos of artists painting the mural from the roof of a nearby building.  Padera told CNN it has been interesting to live in the area. He's been going to most of the protests since they started in late May.  Seattle isn't the only city painting the streets. The trend began in Washington, DC, where the words ""Black Lives Matter"" appear in massive yellow lettering near Capitol Hill. A similar mural also covers a street in Charlotte."," Local artists collaborate to paint a giant Black Lives Matter mural on the street of a white neighborhood, which the artist calls ""the Black Agenda."" The mural is one of many actions by Black Lives Matter activists across the country this week, including the ""I can't breathe"" protest, the ""Black Lives Matter"" march and the ""Say Her Name"" rally in Manhattan.

 So what's in store for us this weekend? Well, for starters, it's time to start thinking about what the future holds. Here are some of the big stories that are shaping up to be some of the most exciting and transformational moments in our lives this year. READ: What's in store for 2016? Here are some of the big stories that are shaping up to be some of the most exciting and transformational moments in our lives this year. 1. Transforming the way we look at race In a world where race is often used as a proxy for class, this year will be different. It will be a time of unprecedented political engagement by people of color. This will be a watershed year for the civil rights movement, with demonstrations across the US and around the globe. The protests have been marked by the most violent and disruptive elements, with at least five people killed in the protests so far. Meanwhile, the global spotlight will be on the American epicenter of the Black Lives Matter movement, Atlanta, where a group of black college students is planning to hold a ""Black Lives Matter"" day. They're also planning to create a ""safe space"" in the city for black people to gather for ""peaceful protest"" on November 28. 2.

56,https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/14/us/black-lives-matter-immigrants-visa-status-protest-trnd/index.html," In the Black Lives Matter movement, immigrants find themselves in a tough position"," Jennifer Scheurle, a German immigrant living in Bellevue on a work visa, says she has always been a politically engaged person, especially having participated in Berlin's strong protest culture prior to arriving in the United States. The Black Lives Matter movement inspired her, but when things turned violent, she was forced to reconcile that with the realities of her visa status. ""I talked to my family and my partner about whether or not it's worth it for me to protest in person and risk the visa. We came to a conclusion that it would be detrimental to my personal well-being and my effectiveness here in the US, if I go back to Germany,"" she said. The consequences of an arrest A foreign national in the US is allowed to participate in peaceful demonstrations or rallies and if they get arrested, the US criminal justice system ensures that they are entitled to the same constitutional protections as a US citizen.  However, the immigration consequences of the arrest may be quite significant. If they get detained, arrested or charged, it could be problematic, even if the charges were dropped, according to Parisa Karaahmet, an immigration attorney at Fragomen, an immigration law firm. ""They could be asked to disclose the arrest in an application for a visa or at a green card interview in the US for any immigration benefits."" Immigrants like Scheurle are largely aware of how these situations could weigh heavily on their immigration status, which could curb their level of participation and their method of expressing their political opinion. ""This is a dilemma that immigrants are facing right now,"" says Andrea Flores, the deputy director of immigration policy for the ACLU. ""So many immigrants want to participate, but the risk is always there. It's important to protest and it's important to stay safe. But the decision is unfair to people who don't have enough protections due to their immigration status."" ""Given the uncertainty that the Trump administration has placed on several visa categories, it's understandable that there is anxiety around participating in protests,"" she adds. 'We're not breaking any law' Several immigrants discussed their concerns with CNN but declined to even go on the record for the fear of consequences. However, not all immigrants are choosing to sit it out.  Prerna Gupta, an Indian national on a work visa, has been going to protests in her neighborhood in Brooklyn.  ""Nothing is wrong with marching with people. We're not breaking any law,"" she said, adding that the violent protests in the past haven't really discouraged her from going.  ""It's a thought but not a big enough thought to reconsider going to a protest."" Gupta says it's important for her to protest because racism is not just an American problem.  ""I have been subjected to racism elsewhere in the world as well. When I'm protesting, I'm also protesting for a change globally,"" she said. She has, however, been taking precautions while protesting. Most of it comes from what she's read on the internet, including not bringing her ID along and wearing all black clothes, so she is not easily identifiable. While Scheurle doesn't want to go to protest in person, she has been helping on the side. She started out by making protest-ready kits for demonstrators. Eventually, she got involved with local groups to help with organizing ground groups for medical attention, setting up supply chains and soliciting donations to get resources in place for helping these protests.  ""I don't know how real the threat of helping the protests is. There is no blueprint for this and nobody can tell me if this is putting me at risk or not. I am in the grey zone so I'm trying to strike the balance between doing as much as I can and protecting my visa."" Understanding the 'special risks' Divyansh Kaushik, an international student working towards a Ph.D at Carnegie Mellon University, is also not joining the protests in Pittsburgh. He is scared about the coronavirus pandemic that is still a threat across the country, and being on a student visa just completely puts protesting out of question. ""If things turn violent and someone points a finger at you, what would you do? There aren't any legal protections,"" he said. ""I could risk losing my [visa] status."" Instead, as the vice president of external affairs at the university's graduate student assembly, Kaushik has been joining his fellow students in demanding the university adopt more inclusive policies and actions. The concern is not limited to a few. Karaahmet says her law firm is getting a lot of questions from clients around this.  ""The issues resonate irrespective of nationality or background. They want their voices heard. But they are concerned about their immigration status and want to know the scope of what their participation can look like,"" she said.  ""A non-US citizen is perfectly entitled to participate, however, there are special risks that they just have to take into account before they make their decision about the activities they want to engage in."" 'I have to have these hard conversations' Protests are critical to the immigrant community, Flores says, and black immigrants have a stake in it, too. ""Because black people are over-policed, that means that additional contacts with the criminal justice system puts black immigrants at increased risk of a violation that jeopardizes their residency in the US,"" she said. If any foreign nationals do find themselves in an encounter with police, a criminal defense lawyer should certainly be their first call and an immigration lawyer should come second, Karaahmet recommends. Ultimately, Kaushik says, a lot of his decisions hinge on his visa status. ""I just try to err on the side of caution."" And Scheurle chooses to think about the people who want her to stay in the US. ""I have to have these hard conversations with people around me who want me to stay. I have a responsibility towards my employer and towards people I love."""," In the Black Lives Matter movement, immigrants find themselves in a tough position, as well. A recent Pew Research poll found that 44% of white Americans said immigrants from other countries should be allowed to stay in the country if they pay a $1.25 billion settlement. But a majority of immigrants -- 61% -- said they would be afraid to return home. That's not to say that no one is turning away from the movement to have the country more like it. Some say they are leaving because they can't feel safe in their communities. ""When you look at the world that we live in now, we are very much in the political moment of the last several months,"" says Jonathan Gray, a political science professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. ""The people that we have to protect ourselves are also leaving us.""
 They say they're protesting police brutality. They're also angry that the police force is ""just as bad"" as the black community, which they say has been the target of excessive force and discriminatory policing. But the Black Lives Matter protesters have been proven right. They say they're tired of seeing a country that has been a target for their activism. They want to make their voices heard. So they've decided to take a stand. ""We are not going to go back to the status quo,"" said Darryl ""D.J."" Johnson, a protester and president of the St. Louis NAACP. ""We are going to make the country better."" Johnson said that while some protesters might be disappointed with the outcome of the election, they are hopeful that the change that they want to see in America is inevitable. ""The revolution is not yet complete,"" Johnson said. ""But we are getting there. We are getting closer."" The day began with a candlelight vigil to honor the victims of the deadly police shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown. The march was meant to mark the anniversary of the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown. Johnson said that while they were protesting, he had heard the phrase ""black lives matter."" ""It's a slogan that means that the lives of black people matter. It's a set of principles that we believe in. We are going to continue to fight for them,"" he said. ""We are going to continue to fight for the rights of black people."" Johnson said he wants to see a ""transformation"" in the way police interact with the black community. He said the Black Lives Matter movement has been able to gain traction because of the use of social media. ""People are emboldened to speak up, to protest,"" he said. ""I believe that is the only way that we can make a real change in the world."" The protesters had been planning for months to protest in the streets. They wanted to create a ""national conversation"" on police brutality and systemic racism. On Friday night, protesters marched from Ferguson's S.E. corner to the White House. They held signs and carried black flags. CNN's Jim Acosta was one of the first journalists to cover the protests. He said he saw some of the protests firsthand. ""I was on the ground for about an hour and a half, and it was very tense,"" he said. ""People were getting shot in the face with plastic bullets. And it was pretty emotional."" Acosta said that while he did not witness any violence, he saw a protester being shot in the head. ""The person I saw was dead, and it was a result of being shot in the head by police officers,"" he said. ""So it's a very tragic outcome. And it was something that happened in the aftermath of the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown, and it's something that we all need to be aware of."" A group of protesters gathered outside of the White House on Saturday, CNN affiliate WCCO reported. They chanted ""No justice, no peace"" and ""Black lives matter."" In New York City, protesters gathered in Manhattan's Bryant Park, CNN affiliate NY1 reported. The protesters were demanding that the police department end its use of ""stop and frisks"" -- a practice that police sometimes use to stop people in the street for alleged crimes. ""This is not a protest about police brutality,"" one demonstrator told the station. ""It's about police brutality in general."" The protest was part of a nationwide Black Lives Matter protest. In Washington, protesters gathered outside the White House. They wore black and carried signs that read, ""Black lives matter,"" CNN affiliate WJLA reported. In Chicago, demonstrators also carried a banner that read, ""No justice, no peace."" Chicago police said the protesters were demonstrating against what they called a ""pattern of brutality."" ""We stand with the people of Chicago. We stand with the people of Missouri,"" Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said in a statement. ""We stand with the people of Ferguson and St. Louis. We stand with the people of all communities that have",994

Lee gets a makeover with Pride Flag and 'Black Lives Matter' sign," The statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee has been the site of many protests since the death of George Floyd and is the same one currently in legal limbo after the governor's order to remove it was met with a lawsuit. After multiple protests, the statue has been covered in multicolor spray paint with phrases like ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""Stop White Supremacy."" Earlier this month, Gov. Ralph Northam announced he would remove the statue honoring the Confederate general, calling it ""wrong"" during a news conference.  His effort has currently been stalled by a county circuit judge.

""Black talent has been exploited at a high level in the NFL"" for decades, Bennett said in the interview, published Friday. ""He knows Black Lives Matter, because without black players, the NFL wouldn't be as lucrative as it is."" In his video statement, Goodell said the league should have listened earlier to players' concerns about racism. But he did not mention former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who has not been offered a contract after receiving backlash for kneeling during the national anthem to protest police brutality.  Bennett told the Daily Beast the NFL's actions need to match Goodell's statement.  ""Is the intent of the NFL to really make a positive impact or is it not to be seen as if they don't respect the players?"" Bennett asked.  ""We have to continuously push the NFL to change its core values and change its moral compass on a consistent basis,"" he said of NFL players. ""If not, shame on us and shame us for real. We have the opportunity to hold Roger Goodell and the rest of the bosses"" to account, he said.  Bennett has long been outspoken on racial issues, publishing a book in 2018 titled, ""Things That Make White People Uncomfortable,"" in which he discussed racism, police brutality and the role of black athletes as political activists.  In 2017, while playing for the Seattle Seahawks, Bennett told CNN he would not stand for the national anthem until he saw ""equality and freedom."" But he stood for the anthem in 2019 as a member of the Dallas Cowboys, he said, because his teammates asked him to. Additionally, Bennett said PR efforts were not enough to forget some NFL owners' backing of President Donald Trump.  ""If you're supporting him, then your letter is really null and void,"" he said. "," Roger Goodell saying Black Lives Matter is 'almost like a slap in the face,' Michael Bennett says. ""What we've got to remember is that the NFL has an agenda and it's not a fan's interest. It's a business' interest. They have an agenda and they're trying to push it on our behalf. They're trying to tell us what to do, when to do it, how to do it.""
 ""I was able to do it because I was a black man, and I was able to do it because I was an American. I was able to do it because I was educated and I was educated in the right direction.

59,https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/11/us/black-lives-matter-hashtag-popularity-trnd/index.html, People are tweeting about Black Lives Matter now more than at any point in the movement's history," The use of the Black Lives Matter hashtag peaked three days after George Floyd died in police custody, a Pew Research Center analysis published this week shows. #BlackLivesMatter was tweeted 8.8 million times that day, according to Pew. For the following 2 weeks, users tweeted #BlackLivesMatter an average of nearly 3.7 million times per day, Pew reported.  The phrase ""Black Lives Matter"" emerged first in 2013 after George Zimmerman was acquitted for the killing of Trayvon Martin. It was recognized more widely during the protests against police brutality in Ferguson, Missouri, after 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot to death by police in 2014.  One of the movement's guiding principles is ending ""state-sanctioned violence,"" which includes killings by police. Recent polling suggests many Americans see this view -- and the recent protests against police brutality -- as legitimate.  A Monmouth University poll released last week found that 78% of Americans said protesters' anger after George Floyd's death was ""at least partially justified."" And a CBS News/YouGov poll found that 57% of Americans believe police in most communities treat whites better than black people.  Before the nationwide police brutality protests began, the use of the hashtag peaked in summer 2016, when it was mentioned around 500,000 times daily, Pew reported. That same summer saw the deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, who were both fatally shot by police in Louisiana and Minnesota respectively.  But even then, ""Black Lives Matter"" wasn't something that most major companies issued statements about or that politicians had painted in the streets.  Clearly, something's different now."," People are tweeting about Black Lives Matter now more than at any point in the movement's history,"" said Chris Ware, director of the Center for the Study of Race and Politics at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. ""It's become a very direct and sustained response to the killing of George Floyd and it's using that as a vehicle for its message."" It's also not hard to see why. The Black Lives Matter movement has been a major force in the wake of police violence and systemic racism in the United States, which has been at the center of international attention. The movement has drawn inspiration from the Black Lives Matter movement in other countries, as well as the Black Lives Matter protests in the United States. ""The Black Lives Matter movement is very much a global phenomenon, and that is reflected in the way that it's being run,"" said Ware. ""There are Black people all over the world who are taking the lead role in the movement."" It's also worth noting that the Black Lives Matter movement has not been without its controversies. The group was criticized for not having a clear leadership structure. But in recent months, the group has been able to build a more cohesive, if not quite unified, front. The group has changed its name several times in recent years, but it remains the same organization.

""Black lives matter to no one,"" shouts one apparent All Lives Matter protester.  The entire incident lasted one minute and 23 seconds, according to video posted to social media that CNN has obtained.  The video appears to have been taken by an All Lives Matter protester and shows what was happening before and after the Black Lives Matter march passed by. About 20 seconds before the police cars escorting the Black Lives Matter march reach the All Lives Matter protesters, a man lies prone on the ground. Shortly after that, another man kneels on his neck, and the re-enactment of Floyd's death begins.   Other eyewitness videos, taken by Black Lives Matters marchers, pick up what happened next.  ""I felt something was happening because the officers began shifting us to the opposite side of the street as we marched closer to that area,"" Russell Sampson, a Black Lives Matter marcher, told CNN.   Ten seconds after the escorting police cars roll by, when the marchers approach, the kneeling man starts shouting at them. ""You don't comply, that's what happens,"" he screams, gesturing at the protesters to the person underneath him.  ""Look ... he didn't comply!  He didn't comply. If he would have complied, that wouldn't have happened."" The organizer of the Black Lives Matter protest in Franklinville, Daryan Fennal, told CNN she was brought to tears seeing the re-enactment.   ""I saw mothers trying to cover their children's eyes,"" she told CNN in a statement. ""Racism is everywhere, but to put it on display in such a gruesome and public way was what surprised me."" After the protesters pass by, the man taking the video then begins commenting on the Black Lives Matter marchers. ""Blacks lives matter to no one,"" he is heard saying in the video. ""All lives matter. All lives matter. Police lives matter. God bless the police. God bless the police. You dumbass protesters."" Corrections officer suspended, FedEx employee fired The re-enactment drew quick criticism as the videos were shared widely on social media.  New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy condemned the behavior, saying that ""mocking"" Floyd's murder to, ""belittle the calls for justice from our black and brown communities is repugnant.""    After the videos surfaced and outrage grew online, the New Jersey Department of Corrections said it had suspended an officer it says was, ""participating in the filming of a hateful and disappointing video that mocked the killing of George Floyd."" The department has also begun a ""thorough and expedited"" investigation into the officer. A source familiar with the situation tells CNN the suspended officer is Joseph DeMarco, who has been employed by NJDOC for at least 18 years. The source said that after having ""a conversation"" with his union on Tuesday, DeMarco retained a private attorney.  DeMarco was to be interviewed by NJDOC internal affairs on Wednesday morning, according to the source.  A hearing will be held after internal affairs makes their recommendation and then it will be decided whether DeMarco is suspended with or without pay, the source says. Multiple calls by CNN to DeMarco have not been returned.  Local union President William Sullivan told CNN the union -- which represents approximately 6,000 correctional police officers in New Jersey -- was made aware of the incident around 12:30 p.m. on Tuesday after ""a lot of officers called in and were upset."" ""We need to continue practicing tolerance and understanding; not discrimination and hate,"" the union said in a statement on their Facebook page. ""As a collective group, we pray for those who are hurting and we are here to help each and every one of them heal.""  In a statement, FedEx said it has fired one employee it it allegedly saw in the video at the protest. ""FedEx holds its team members to a high standards of personal conduct, and we do not tolerate the kind of appalling and offensive behavior depicted in this video. The individual involved is no longer employed by FedEx. We stand with those who support justice and equality,"" reads the statement.  CNN continues to try to reach the former FedEx employee for comment, as well as the suspended corrections officer.  But Daryann Fennal, the Black Lives Matter organizer, says this won't take away from her efforts. She says she can't ""unsee"" the re-enactment and calls it scary and terrifying. ""Despite the horrible incident we witnessed, I remain hopeful for the future and I hope we at least reached one person's heart yesterday,"" she said."," All Lives Matter protesters re-enacted George Floyd's death as a Black Lives Matter march went by   Thursday, August 13, 2017, the day after the killing of Floyd in Minneapolis. Police said Floyd was interfering with their investigation of the case, which was being handled by the same officers. The officers were fired last week.  CNN's Chris Cillizza, reporting from New York, said that the officers who were fired last week had been seen on video at the scene of the killing and were ""dressed in full riot gear"" before the event was set to begin. CNN's Geoff Bennett said that the New York Police Department has launched an internal investigation into the death of Floyd. The officers were not wearing body cameras, Bennett said. CNN's Ali Velshi reported that Floyd was shot on the ground by an officer after he allegedly spit at him. The officer was not charged in the death. The New York Police Department has said that Floyd was acting aggressively toward officers. His death comes as protests around the country are being watched closely by the public and police departments. Floyd, a black man, was shot by Minneapolis police in the back of the neck on Thursday night as he lay dying from a gunshot wound to his head. The officer, Derek Chauvin, was charged with murder on Friday. Floyd's death has sparked protests across the country in recent days as demonstrators have demanded justice for Floyd, a 43-year-old father of six. Floyd was shot in the back as he lay on the ground, handcuffed, after he was shot by police. Police said that Floyd spit at officers before he was shot.  CNN's Jake Tapper said that protesters have been wearing masks and carrying weapons in the streets. ""I'm told that they are also carrying weapons and masks, and that's where the violence is coming from,"" he said. ""And I think that's a good thing, because we're trying to find out what happened there."" CNN's Sara Sidner said that it's a ""very tense time"" in the country. ""I think that's why we're seeing it. And it's why the protests are being watched very closely, because there's a lot of tension between police and the communities that they're supposed to serve and protect,"" she said. ""And that tension can lead to violence."" CNN's Jim Acosta said that it's ""very difficult"" for him to understand why protesters are ""not having a conversation"" with police about how they can prevent violence from happening. ""I understand that. I'm also not surprised that the police are not having that conversation,"" he said. ""The police have said that in the past. And I understand that. It's very difficult for all of us to understand why that has not happened."" CNN Political Analyst Van Jones said that it's a ""very complex situation."" ""There's a lot of nuance in it. There's a lot of gray area. There's a lot of gray areas that you have to navigate,"" he said. ""And I think it's going to be a very, very, very, very, difficult conversation for all of us to have."" CNN Political Analyst Van Jones said that the protests are a ""very divisive issue"" and that ""it's going to be very hard for people to come to terms with one another."" ""The way I look at it is this: People are upset because they feel like they're being mistreated,"" he said. ""But we can't have a conversation about how to treat our neighbors because we're not all the same."" CNN Political Analyst Van Jones said that there's a ""huge amount of pent up anger"" and ""tension and tension"" that can lead to violence. ""The way I look at it is this: The way to get out of this is not to go around in the streets and make a scene",759
61,https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/11/us/five-things-june-11-trnd/index.html," 5 things to know for June 11: Coronavirus, Black Lives Matter, immigration, election, Nigeria"," Here's what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.  (You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Coronavirus There are now more than 2 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the US, and health experts have issued a new and bleak prediction: Following widespread reopenings, another 100,000 people in the US will die of the disease by September, pushing the death toll to well above 200,000. While infection numbers and hospitalizations are going up in some states, health officials in Missouri are looking into an unusual case. Two hairstylists there who worked while they had coronavirus symptoms did not infect the 140 clients they served in mid-May. County health officials called the result encouraging and said they're looking into the case for insight on how to stop the virus' spread. 2. Black Lives Matter NASCAR has banned Confederate flags from all its races and events after African American driver Bubba Wallace called on the racing body to crack down on fans using the symbol. It's the latest move by a major brand amid protests for racial justice. US Soccer also repealed a policy requiring players to stand during the National Anthem, and some US military leaders are considering renaming bases that honor Confederate commanders. Around the country, statues of Christopher Columbus and other problematic historical figures are coming down. On the legislative side, the Trump administration is reportedly mulling an executive order on police reform, though it's unclear what it may contain. And in a case many activists say has gone under the radar during recent protests, the detective who applied for the warrant that ended in the March shooting death of Breonna Taylor has been placed on administrative reassignment. 3. Immigration A new Trump administration proposal would make it harder for migrants to claim asylum in the US. An asylum claim could face greater scrutiny if the person traveled through at least one country on the way to the US but didn't seek refuge there. It would also punish people who lived unlawfully in the US for a long time before applying for asylum. Though the latest rules don't mention the coronavirus, the past few months have seen more than a dozen changes to the immigration system tied to the pandemic: Immigration hearings have been postponed, refugee admissions have been put on pause and migrants have largely been barred from entering the US. In fact, the American Civil Liberties Union just filed a lawsuit against some of these stringent border restrictions. 4. Election 2020 After Georgia's disastrous primary, election officials across the US are getting more concerned about the fall presidential contest. Besides long lines and technical problems, polling places in some counties changed at the last minute as some sites pulled out due to coronavirus concerns. Georgia voters also had trouble with mail-in ballots that had confusing instructions. All in all, the state was overwhelmed with nearly 1.6 million absentee ballot applications and struggled to process them all. This may be a worrying sign that other states new to mail-in voting could face similar challenges as they ramp up for November. 5. Nigeria At least 81 people, including women and children, have been killed in an attack on a village by suspected Boko Haram militants in northeast Nigeria. Residents said men attacked the village in armored tanks and trucks filled with guns, the government reported. The Nigerian military is sending more troops to the area, and local officials want the military's help in ending the terrorist group's long-running campaign of indiscriminate violence in the region. Tens of thousands of people have been killed and more than 3 million people displaced during the region's Boko Haram insurgency that dates back more than a decade.

 The $1 trillion deal is the largest ever trade agreement between the US and China, and could bring billions of dollars in new jobs and economic growth. But it also risks undermining US sovereignty and could lead to a new war between the two superpowers. Here's what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. 1. Trade negotiations The US and China are expected to reach a deal on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a massive Pacific Rim trade deal that could be the most significant in US history. The deal, which is expected to be negotiated in secret, is expected to contain strict intellectual property protections for US companies and could pave the way for US-based companies to dominate Asia's biggest economy. But it could also be derailed by US lawmakers and the courts. The US already has a lengthy, highly-controversial agreement with 11 other countries that would cover areas like cars, agriculture, pharmaceuticals, aerospace, chemicals, food, financial services, and medical devices. The US is also negotiating an agreement with 10 other countries to protect intellectual property. 2. Russia investigation The FBI has opened an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election, a senior US official told CNN. The official said it was the first time that the FBI has opened a counterintelligence investigation into the matter. The probe is looking into allegations that Russia tried to interfere in the election and sought to influence the outcome. 3. North Korea North Korea's threats The isolated regime has issued a series of threats against the US and South Korea. Pyongyang says it will attack the US and South Korea with nuclear weapons if it attacks the US or its allies. The threats come as both nations brace for an imminent sixth nuclear test. 4. Brexit The UK's Brexit negotiations are set to begin this week, with the first phase of negotiations expected to take between two and six months. Brexit Secretary David Davis said he expects to conclude the deal by the end of March. The UK has asked to leave the European Union ahead of a planned June 23 deadline. But the EU has said it will not allow the UK to leave without a deal. 5. Trump The President has been in office for less than a month, but already the damage has already been done. His inauguration was marred by chaos and protests, and the first days of his presidency were marked by his bizarre tweets and frequent feuds with the media. He has already sparked international outcry with his incendiary comments about the First Amendment and the First Lady's looks. BREAKFAST BROWSE People are talking about these. Read up. Join in.

62,https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/09/us/bubba-wallace-confederate-flag-trnd/index.html, NASCAR's Bubba Wallace will have Black Lives Matter paint scheme on car at Martinsville Speedway race," ""I think by running this branding on our car, putting the hashtag out there, bringing more awareness to it, it lines up with the videos that we had put out as NASCAR,"" Wallace, the first full-time African American driver in the Cup Series since 1971, said. ""Listening and learning. Educating ourselves. So people will look up what this hashtag means. And hopefully get a better understanding."" Car owner Richard Petty Motorsports announced Tuesday that Wallace's car at Martinsville Speedway in Virginia will be black with the words ""#blacklivesmatter"" on the rear quarterpanels. Underneath each hashtag will be a large peace symbol with hands of people of different races. The hood will feature a painting of a white and a black hand clasped with the saying,""Compassion, love, understanding."" The same words will be on the rear bumper. Martinsville is one of the tracks where Confederate flags are often seen in the parking lots and campgrounds, but Wednesday's race will have no fans. NASCAR won't allow limited numbers of fans in the grandstands until June 14 at the Cup race in Homestead, Florida.  Wallace, 26, became the first African American driver since Wendell Scott (1963) to win an event sponsored by NASCAR when he won a trucks series race at Martinsville in 2013. At a race Sunday, Wallace wore the T-shirt in solidarity with protesters around the world who have been calling for justice in the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died at the hands of Minneapolis police.  As the protests have raged on, officials in Virginia have started taking action to remove confederate monuments in some states and military bases are taking away confederate paraphernalia. Wallace told CNN's Don Lemon on Monday the next steps now are ""to get rid of all Confederate flags."" ""No one should feel uncomfortable when they come to a NASCAR race. It starts with Confederate flags,"" Wallace said. ""Get them out of here. They have no place for them."" Initially Confederate flags did not bother him, Wallace said, but after educating himself he sees how uncomfortable it makes people.  ""There's going to be a lot of angry people that carry those flags proudly but it's time for change,"" he said. ""We have to change that, and I encourage NASCAR to have those conversations to remove those flags."" If fans don't agree, Wallace said they can ""get back on the road where you came from."" ""We should not be able to have an argument over that,"" he said. ""It is a thick line we cannot cross anymore.""  In 2015, NASCAR asked fans not to bring Confederate flags to races and even had a flag exchange program. ""We are committed to providing a welcoming atmosphere free of offensive symbols. This is an opportunity for NASCAR Nation to demonstrate its sense of mutual respect and acceptance for all who attend our events while collectively sharing the tremendous experience of NASCAR racing,"" the racing body said. The Blue-Emu Maximum Pain Relief 500 is set to run Wednesday at 7 p.m. ET, weather permitting. Thunderstorms are in the forecast, according to the National Weather Service."," NASCAR's Bubba Wallace will have Black Lives Matter paint scheme on car at Martinsville Speedway race in Virginia. The NASCAR executive said it was an effort to ""show the world that we care about each other,"" and said he will ""keep working to bring awareness to the issues that affect all of us in NASCAR today."" ""I'm proud to say that we are changing NASCAR's history books to reflect on the lessons of our past, and continue to build the future of racing and sport,"" NASCAR said in a statement. NASCAR said Wallace will wear the paint scheme during the upcoming season, which begins July 1.
 It's the sort of story that would have been passed around on the family-run golf course in South Florida. But in the wake of the Charleston shooting, the story has been passed around on Twitter by some as well. The tweet, which has since been deleted, said: ""#Charleston killer was a fan of the #MLS.

One of the locations will be near City Hall, and the other locations will be decided with participants, activists and city leaders, de Blasio said.  ""Black Lives Matter"" will also be painted on the streets. The announcement came after a Sunday meeting with activists, including Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, who died in 2014 after an NYPD officer used a chokehold on him. The officer, Daniel Pantaleo, was fired but did not face criminal charges. Spurred by the police killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other black people, protesters have marched in New York City for the past few weeks and called for an end to systemic racism in policing. Some protesters have called to ""defund the police,"" and de Blasio said Sunday he plans to shift funding from police to youth and social services. Last week, Washington, DC, painted ""Black Lives Matter"" in large yellow letters down a busy DC street. Mayor Muriel Bowser also officially deemed the section of 16th Street bearing the mural as ""Black Lives Matter Plaza,"" complete with a new street sign."," New York City will name a street 'Black Lives Matter' in each borough. A black Lives Matter flag will be displayed on all city buildings and infrastructure. The flag will be carried by all city employees and officers, the city manager said in a statement.

 The city's first police officer-led grand jury in more than 20 years has decided not to indict a white officer in the death of Eric Garner. The decision was the first time since 1997 that a grand jury did not indict a white officer. The decision, which was not announced until hours after a press conference by the city's police chief, James O'Neill, and the mayor, was the culmination of weeks of public pressure and debate. The decision comes as the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after police attempted to arrest him for allegedly selling cigarettes illegally, sparked protests and protests in the United",221

She showed how to stare him down.," In a video shared on social media, a man is seen yelling profanities at a group of demonstrators supporting Black Lives Matter in Whitefish, about 60 miles from the Canadian border.  The man, identified by police as Jay Snowden, 51, is clearly agitated and becomes increasingly so as the group starts chanting ""peaceful!"" to drown out his yelling. In a powerful image shared by Samantha Francine, who is one of the protesters, Snowden, a tall white man, is seen looking down on a much smaller Francine while she looks up into his eyes, holding a poster that reads ""Say Their Names."" Francine, who is biracial, told CNN that in that heated moment with Snowden standing inches away from her face, she felt no fear.  See the video (warning: there is some inappropriate language): The 27-year-old protester said the words of her white father, who died 16 years ago, ran through her head: ""No matter who the threat is, no matter what the threat is, you look them in the eye so that they know you're human."" ""In that moment, I felt those words that my father spoke to me from such a young age and I saw fear in his eyes and I knew he wasn't going to hurt me,"" Francine said. ""He was just upset and uncomfortable, so I just stood my ground and it got captured in such a beautiful way."" Snowden was ultimately removed from the scene by police. Later, after police consulted with the Whitefish city prosecutor, he was charged with disorderly conduct,Whitefish police said in a statement posted on social media. He is expected in court on June 17. ""The City of Whitefish is dedicated to protecting the First Amendment rights of individuals to peacefully protest and ask all who are involved to respect each other's rights and protest peacefully,"" police said. CNN has reached out to Snowden but he did not respond to CNN's request for comment. It's not clear if he has an attorney. Asked about how she feels about the way people viewed the incident, Francine said, ""I have gone through so much, experienced so much the last 27 years and in that moment everything I've gone through made sense."" She said that every person who's yelled at her like that, every person who's hurt her feelings, let her down or embarrassed her led her to that moment. ""I was surrounded by so many awesome people in that moment and there was such an incredible energy—I just knew what to do,"" she said. Francine said she has no malice in her heart toward Snowden and in fact delivered a gift basket to his wife on Saturday to let her know that she knows his wife doesn't embody her husband.

The thing I love most about her is that she was willing to do anything for me. She was my rock on the roller coaster ride and I will never forget that. I will never forget that she took the time to listen to my story and that's why she's so inspiring to me. She was the type of person who would make you laugh or cry at the same time. She was always there for you no matter what. She was like a second father to me. I am so grateful to have had the chance to work with her and to have met her. She is one of my heroes.
 A new national poll from CNN and the Kaiser Family Foundation shows that while support for President Trump has grown since the election, it's still not enough for Democrats to take back the Senate. Fifty-six percent of Democrats say they would vote for Republicans in 2018, compared to 37% who would vote for Democrats. Among Republicans, support for Trump's agenda is lukewarm. Sixty-one percent say they would vote for the president, but only 26% say they would vote for Democrats. Trump's unpopularity also doesn't help Democrats much, with 41% saying they would vote for a third-party candidate in 2020. Meanwhile, more than six in ten Democrats say they would support a third-party candidate in 2020. Trump's popularity also hasn't helped Democrats much, with 51% saying they would vote for someone else in 2020. While Democrats are still focused on the 2018 midterms, the president's unpopularity has started to hurt them in other areas. Fifty-one percent of Republicans say the economy will take a major hit if they don't enact tax reform before the end of the year, while fewer than half of Democrats say that. And a majority of Republicans say that the nation's infrastructure is in bad shape, as well. All that said, there are still bright spots for Democrats in the poll. Fifty-three percent of Democrats say the economy is doing fine, compared to 36% who say it's ""very good"" or ""excellent."" And just over half say they would vote for a third-party candidate in 2020, with just over a third saying they would vote for a third-party candidate in 2020. That said, there are still areas where Democrats could use the boost. More than six in ten say",473

""It was the most overwhelming feeling that I had in my heart,"" Kerry Anne told CNN. ""I could feel everything, I could feel all the current energy around us in that current moment."" For Michael, he told CNN the moment went by in a flash but he's grateful to have this moment to remember for the rest of their lives.  ""Not to say that we are more important than or above anything that was going on or anything that was being discussed at the event, just to be a part of that was humbling,"" he said. ""Seeing my not-yet wife for the first time that day in that manner, was the most amazing moment for both of us.""  The couple had planned to wed on May 26, but due to the coronavirus pandemic, their plans kept getting rescheduled, Kerry Anne said. ""We were planning for this for so long and for the day to pass, it hurt and was kind of painful,"" she said. ""But we decided that we didn't want to prolong our love and starting our life together as husband and wife,"" she said. Over the course of two weeks, Kerry Anne asked 21 of her and Michael's immediate family members to join them in the courtyard of The Logan Hotel. Even though the hotel has closed its doors because of the pandemic, they offered up their courtyard for a small ceremony, Kerry Anne said. When Kerry Anne found out that the weekend's Black Lives Matter protests were set to take place close to her wedding location, she was conflicted because she said she wanted to take part in them but knew she wanted to kick off this new chapter in her life with Michael. The plan for the couple to see each other for the first time was always meant to take place on the corner of the hotel, according to Kerry Anne. She said when she walked outside to meet Michael, she was initially alone and away from protesters. By the time Michael began his walk to meet her, the demonstrators had marched closer and closer to her. Eventually, they moved in around her and started cheering and clapping as Michael made his way to greet her. Linda McQueen, the couple's wedding photographer, told CNN protestors were chanting ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""Black Love Matters"" as they gathered around the couple with their bright colored, handmade signs.  McQueen has photographed hundreds of weddings in her career but said The Gordons' wedding will always have a special place in her heart. ""Witnessing thousands of people, from different cultures, races and creeds, all unite in encouraging this couple on their union...I got so emotional that it brought me to tears as I photographed this epic moment.""  Kerry Anne wrote her vows for Michael five months prior to their wedding day and said she had not looked at them since. She said she wrote about how Michael was the perfect example of what a black man is and should be. ""To know that we are in a movement right now, that we are here for a bigger cause, it really touched my heart and my soul,"" she said. ""It reflected on everything historically, going back hundreds of years ago and really bring us to this moment where I can say, I can stand next to him and say I'm proud. I'm proud of this black man, my black man."""," This couple's wedding first look happened in front of a Black Lives Matter protest. It was a celebration of love and a call to action. ""It was beautiful,"" she said. ""And I'm glad that they chose to participate in it. It was a great way to start the day."" ""It was so powerful and moving to see so many people together.""
 The father-of-six, who was killed in a hail of bullets, was known to police and federal investigators as the man they called the ""Black Lives Matter killer."" He had a long list of possible crimes, but investigators believe he was most likely behind the killing of Michael Oehme, a 38-year-old bank teller who had been shot to death in his apartment earlier this month. ""We have no idea what happened in his past,"" said Greg Stivers, the attorney representing Oehme's family. ""He had a history of mental illness and violence and was on the run for years."" But Oehme's family, and the officers involved in his death, say they believe the police account. ""They've tried to paint him as a killer, but we don't believe that,"" said Oehme's brother, Christopher Oehme, adding that they believe the officers were responding to a call from a neighbor who said a man was breaking car windows and pouring gasoline on their street. ""There's no evidence that he was violent in any way,"" Oehme said. ""He was a nice, loving guy who was very respectful of his elders and very family-oriented."" In a statement Thursday night, Oehme's family said they were ""heartbroken and angry"" at the actions of the police and FBI. ""Mr. Oehme was a loving and caring person who was deeply respected by his peers and family,"" the family said. ""He was respected by his community for his caring nature, and for his love of music and dancing."" The officers involved in his death were placed on administrative leave. The officers involved in his death are white. ""We are in shock, angry and saddened by the events of this morning,"" said Oehme's sister, Traci Oehme, in a statement. ""We want the community to know that we will not rest until justice prevails."" The family members said the officer involved in his death was not wearing a body camera. The video from the body camera is not publicly available, but Oehme's family said it shows the officer firing eight shots, striking Oehme eight times. The family members said Oehme was shot eight times. ""The police officer did not have to shoot Mr. Oehme. He shot him because he was a threat to him,"" said Christopher Oehme. ""The police officer did not have to shoot him. He shot him because he was a threat to himself."" The family members said they would release more details about the investigation on Tuesday.

Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser commissioned the mural, which spans two blocks of 16th Street, as protests across the nation and the globe continue against police brutality after the deaths of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd.  With these protests, ""Black Lives Matter,"" already a well-known phrase, has become even more popular -- even internationally. This mural cements that.  Bowser has also officially deemed the section of 16th Street bearing the mural as ""Black Lives Matter Plaza,"" complete with a new street sign. Still, the gesture has not been welcomed by all. The DC chapter of the Black Lives Matter Global Network has criticized it, calling it ""performative."" ""This is a performative distraction from real policy changes. Bowser has consistently been on the wrong side of BLMDC history,"" the group tweeted. ""This is to appease white liberals while ignoring our demands. Black Lives Matter means defund the police.""

In a statement released through his attorneys, Brennan apologized, saying he recognized his ""outrageous behavior"" was ""unacceptable and wrong.""  ""I am sick with remorse for the pain and fear I caused the victims on the trail and online,"" he said, adding he was cooperating with authorities. ""I am committed to making amends by addressing, through counseling, the underlying issues that led to my abhorrent behavior."" Brennan said he was ""dedicated"" to working to bring peace to the community and justice to ""all victims of racism and police brutality."" The incident took place on Monday when a man and two women were walking the Capital Crescent Trail in Montgomery County posting flyers in support of Black Lives Matter. According to police, the suspect started to argue with them about the flyers and forcibly grabbed some flyers from one of the victims.  He then pushed his bicycle toward the male victim causing him to fall to the ground, according to police. The male victim recorded the entire incident. After the incident Maryland-National Capital Park Police asked the public for help finding the suspect and community members sent in hundreds of tips over the past few days. Police used various sources to further corroborate that information before identifying Brennan.  Park police contacted Brennan and his legal counsel on Friday and they consented to having Brennan's home searched while members of the Montgomery County State's Attorney's Office and Park Police were present. Police say they found and seized evidence at the home. Police then served Brennan with an arrest warrant Friday evening, after he had voluntarily turned himself in, a police statement said.

 It's a photo of a young black man holding up a sign that says, ""I can't breathe."" It's a message that's been shared on Twitter more than 200,000 times. It's the kind of message that's been a part of the American psyche since the day we were born. It's the message that's been on our lips for years. And it's the message that's being sent right now. The photo was sent to CNN by a man who asked to remain anonymous. He says he lives in a small town in Mississippi and says he's not worried about what the young man is doing. ""I don't care. He's doing what he's doing. He's not threatening my people. He's not threatening anybody's people,"" he said. ""I'm sorry. I'm not surprised. I just feel like it's an innocent act. Like I said, I just feel like it's the right thing to do."" 'He's not threatening my people' The young man in the photo is not the first person to draw attention to the young black man's message. In 2014, a 19-year-old college student from Missouri, named Tanishia Covington, drew attention to the young black man's message when she posted a photo of a sign she'd made for a protest in her hometown of Columbia, Missouri. The sign read: ""I can't breathe."" Covington's post went viral and received widespread attention, garnering support from people who said that she was making a statement about the power of the young black men who have been killed by police.

They're also in America's small towns," Participating in her hometown's protest in Paducah, Kentucky, gave her an opportunity to show her young, mixed-race kids that their voices matter, especially as black people are fighting to be heard in the wake of George Floyd's death. The 23-year-old said she was proud to see her small town fight for justice in such a big way at the Chief Paduke statue, a historical marker for the town. ""We all bleed red,"" Willie said. ""We are all one and the protest really showed that our community came together. It was beautiful.""  And the message that Willie believes has been sent to her kids is this: ""They are powerful, unique, brave and should be unapologetic about who they are and what they stand for,"" Willie said. Thousands have demonstrated in communities across the world to protest and demand racial justice in the aftermath of George Floyd's death. The 46-year-old black man died May 25 at the hands of Minneapolis police with his last moments caught on video. The national stage has shown us protests in big cities like Washington DC, New York City and Los Angeles, but small towns that dot the map -- ones you may never hear about -- are also protesting with small acts of solidarity. State College, Pennsylvania State College, Pennsylvania, is home to Penn State University, making it predominately a college town. With the majority of its students away for the summer, Ryan Jones was surprised to see hundreds of people show up in the city's downtown area on Sunday. The town, 192 miles west of Philadelphia, is in the middle of an otherwise white and rural part of the state, according to Jones. ""Silence very much feels like complicity at this point,"" he said. ""The anger driving the protests is clearly justified, and no one's ever made the point better than Dr. King: 'A riot is the language of the unheard.'"" Local police officers were in attendance but kept their distance and showed restraint, according to Jones. He said while participating he could feel the anger and intensity but the demonstration was peaceful.  Jones and his 15-year-old son marched with what he estimates to be somewhere between 1,000 and 1,500 people. Farmington, Missouri During Tuesday's protest at the St. Francois County Courthouse in Farmington, 73 miles south of St. Louis, Missouri, Grace Gilliam said she felt closer to her community then ever before. Gilliam, who is home from college for the summer, said growing up, it was difficult to be vocal in Farmington because she found many in her community were narrow-minded. But on Tuesday, she saw people who wanted to embrace other ways of thinking. ""Even if it was small, it was loud, and it was powerful,"" she said. ""Some people don't see that these things happen everywhere. It is not specifically in big cities where people of color are facing injustices, it's all over America.""  Holland, Arkansas  Even though farmer Chad Jones was solo in his efforts, he, too, wanted to show his kids that even the smallest gesture can have the biggest impact. Holland is home to 552 people and though the community is small, Jones said he wanted to ""help change hearts and minds, and show that ""not all small towns come with small minds.'""  So he stood outside his farm with his homemade ""Black Lives Matter"" sign while wearing a ""Defend Equality"" t-shirt. After a while, a fellow farmer expressed interest in joining him. ""It's relieving to see more with open minds,"" Jones said. ""People are angry. This has been going on for years and it keeps happening. I understand why people of color are frustrated."" Solebury, Pennsylvania Solebury had its primary elections on Tuesday, so Mallory Carr seized the moment by voting and protesting with her neighbors. Corr grew up in Solebury, a town with a conservative history. And she says she's never seen so much activism in her small town, 44 miles north of Philadelphia. ""I was admittedly naïve thinking a protest in my small town wouldn't matter as much in the shadow of Philly, NYC, and DC nearby but we gathered at a safe distance,"" she said. With protesters socially distanced from one another, Carr and other community members stood along the road between the police station and a church with handwritten signs that said, ""Black Lives Matter. White silence is violence."" ""I think real change can happen when you have hard conversations with people, and being a member of this tight-knit community, I can use my privilege to be vocal about what I believe is right,"" she said."," Black Lives Matter protests aren't just happening in big cities. They're also in America's small towns and rural areas. There are several reasons people are taking to the streets. One is that they're angry about what they see as a lack of police accountability in the aftermath of the Michael Brown case in Ferguson, Missouri. Another is that they want to protest the actions of the federal government and other authorities. But one thing that's clear is that the protests are taking on an entirely different tone. It's no longer about the actions of a few rogue officers. It's now about the actions of the many, who are increasingly showing that they are not interested in the rights and freedoms of black people. Some of that change is already being felt. For example, the protests in Chicago and New York have seen a significant decline in violence. But the city's black and brown communities are still feeling the effects of years of neglect and abuse. So it's no surprise that people are taking to the streets. They're no longer afraid to be themselves. It's no longer a black-and-white issue. It's now a color-of-life issue.
 The young man, who was not identified, was shot and killed by a police officer in an apparent ""malicious"" act. The shooting was captured on a body camera. The video was posted on Facebook. It was shot by a bystander who was also inside the car. The officer, who is white, has been charged with first-degree murder.

""And he did not violate those policies."" The officer is white, the man is black. The video shows the teen walking away from officers as he's shot. He doesn't appear to be trying to run away. The officers follow him, trying to arrest him, who is heard saying, ""I can't breathe."" The officers then fire multiple shots, striking the teen multiple times. ""I don't want to see this kid's picture,"" said Thomas Thomas. ""I want to see him face to face and I want to hear his side of the story. I want to know what happened that day."" The officer's attorney said the teen was shot by a police officer because he was trying to flee. ""This is a black kid that was walking home from a convenience store to a football game with his mom and he was shot by a police officer because he was trying to run,"" attorney Keith Kerkow told CNN's ""AC360."" ""And that cop got away with it because he was afraid of him."" A police union official said the officers were not responding to a report of a suspicious person when they were confronted by the teen. ""There is no video of this incident,"" Mark Jamieson, a spokesman for the union, said in a statement.

Still, he arrived at Parliament Hill -- home to Canada's Parliament -- wearing a black cloth mask Friday afternoon and surrounded by security guards, according to CNN affiliate CTVnews.  Trudeau did not speak at the event, though he clapped and nodded along with some of the other speakers, including a moment when a speaker asserted there is no middle ground on racism. At another point, he yelled ""Amen"" along with other protesters after a speaker discussed promoting love and justice. Some in the crowd shouted at him to stand up to US President Donald Trump, CTVnews reported. Though many celebrities have been outspoken about their support for protesters in the US, support from world leaders has been muted, despite global protests featuring the Black Lives Matter slogan. On Monday, the Canadian leader paused for nearly 20 seconds when asked about the President, looking visibly uncomfortable before side-stepping the question. Friday's protest was organized by No Peace Until Justice as part of a slew of protests against police brutality and systemic racism around the world following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The crowd had a moment of silence for almost nine minutes -- the amount of time former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kept his knee pressed on Floyd's neck. During this silence, many took a knee, too.  Trudeau joined them.  The Ottawa Police Service told CTVnews in a statement the march was peaceful. ""We respect the rights of our residents and community members to speak out when they see injustices and we understand the community's deep pain and frustration,"" they said. ""Our role is to provide a safe space for people to grieve and be heard.""

Each of the 16 bold yellow letters spans the width of the two-lane street, creating an unmistakable visual easily spotted by aerial cameras and virtually anyone within a few blocks.  The painters were contacted by Mayor Muriel Bowser and began work early Friday morning, the mayor's office told CNN. Bowser has officially deemed the section of 16th Street bearing the mural ""Black Lives Matter Plaza,"" complete with a new street sign.   Bowser told reporters outside of St John's Church next to Lafayette Park that she and DC Council members were there ""as Washingtonians -- we simply all want to be here together in peace to demonstrate that in America -- you can peacefully assemble, you can bring grievances to your government, and you can demand change."" ""We're here peacefully as Americans, on American streets, on DC streets,"" Bowser said, seeming to reference the recent clash that she has had with the federal government over their attempts to police DC streets. The DC chapter of the Black Lives Matter Global Network criticized the gesture. ""This is a performative distraction from real policy changes. Bowser has consistently been on the wrong side of BLMDC history. This is to appease white liberals while ignoring our demands. Black Lives Matter means defund the police,"" the group tweeted. Washington has been the site of more than a week's worth of protests in response to the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers.

 This week, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a case that could decide the future of voting rights for millions of Americans. The justices will decide whether to hear the case from the bench or hear it from the nation's highest court. The case, Shelby County v. Holder, concerns the 2014 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals to hold off on hearing a lawsuit brought by the Black Lives Matter activist, who contends that the 2014 Shelby County Voting Rights Act, which the court declared unconstitutional, violated the rights of African-Americans. The court's decision to hold off on hearing the case will be a victory for activists who have pressed on for months to have the ruling applied to all 50 states. The justices will hear arguments in the case, which will be the first time since the mid-1990s that voting rights have come up in the high court's docket. ""It is a victory for all Americans and particularly for Black Lives Matter activists,"" said activist DeRay Mckesson. ""The Court's decision today is a victory for everyone who has fought for the right to vote, especially Black women and girls who have been disproportionately impacted by the Court's failure to protect their right to vote.""

A man and two women were walking the trail, posting flyers in support of Black Lives Matter, when the suspect started to argue with them about the flyers and grabbed the flyers from one of the victims, the release said. Police say the suspect then pushed his bicycle and started to charge one of the victims, causing them to fall to the ground. Park Police have released images of the suspect, asking for help in finding the man, who is described as a 50 to 60-year-old white male, medium build, 6 feet in height, with short brown hair. Park Police officers are patrolling the trail by foot, bicycle, and police car, the release said. The man who shot the video of the cyclist confronting him and his friends while posting the signs told CNN they were out trying to influence change. The man asked to not be identified for fear of retaliation and says he was out with two other friends posting flyers when they were approached by the cyclist. The man alleges the cyclist rode past them, then turned around and approached them. ""At first he seemed intrigued at our message, but he quickly got aggressive and tore the sheets from my hands,"" he said. That's when he pulled his phone out and started recording. CNN cannot independently verify what happened prior to and after the video. What the video shows The video shows the cyclist approach another member of the group, who tells him to stay away. The cyclist then turns around toward the third member of the group and tears a roll of tape she had around her wrist. The man behind the camera says that's when the cyclist noticed he was filming and grabbed the bike and charged him.  In the video, he then falls to the ground. He says the cyclist demanded the tape he had in his hands. The recording ends as the man picks up his phone. He says the cyclist then rode down the path a bit before turning back around and yelling obscenities at the group before riding back the way he came. Since the incident, the man who shot the video says he's been back out placing more signs and has had people asking him for signs to post themselves. ""I spent my high school years in DC and I'm fortunate enough to live in an affluent neighborhood now where I feel I have a lot of privilege,"" he said.

""They didn't find him. They found a guy who tried to kill somebody,"" he said. ""So the question is, what happened to the guy that tried to kill somebody?"" In a statement, the NYPD said officers ""found a man who they believe to be responsible for this attack."" The NYPD said he was shot and killed. Officers were ""assassassinated"" when they tried to arrest the man, it said. ""This was a man who they thought was going to kill them, not only because of their race but also because of their profession,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio said. ""They were shot and killed by a man they thought was a killer."" Police have said the man was a ""lone wolf"" attacker, but a video captured by witnesses shows the man only a few feet away from the officers. ""I was on the phone with my girlfriend, she was screaming, 'Get him! Get him!'"" one witness said on CNN. ""I didn't see any gun or any other weapon."" The mayor and de Blasio said the man's behavior at the scene is being investigated by the NYPD and the FBI. ""It is clear that he was not the person that police believed,"" de Blasio said. ""This is not a race issue. This is a human being issue."" Protesters have been demanding justice for Floyd, an unarmed black man who was killed by a white police officer in Brooklyn in March. The mayor said he had reached out to Floyd's family to see if they wanted to be part of the protests. ""I want to make sure that the family gets the care that they need,"" de Blasio said. ""I want to make sure that the NYPD gets the care that they need, and we want to make sure that the community understands that there are consequences to this type of action.""

While these posts may be well-intended, several activists and influencers have pointed out that posting a blank black image with a bunch of tags clogs up critical channels of information and updates. Protests are still raging around the country. Arrests are piling up by the thousands. Visibility for different groups and activist projects are key right now.  And one of the most common ways to keep track of all of this is by monitoring or searching tags.  ""We know that's it no intent to harm but to be frank, this essentially does harm the message,"" mental health advocate and Black Lives Matter activist Kenidra Woods posted on Twitter. ""We use hashtag to keep ppl updated. PLS stop using the hashtag for black images!!"" A video scroll of the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag on Instagram proves her point: It's row after row of black squares, with very few posts of note in between.  Don't use the #BlackLivesMatter tag, activists say  There are two issues here: One, the actual tags used on Blackout Tuesday posts. Two, the actual purpose of posting a black image in the first place.  When you post an image with a tag on, say, Twitter or Instagram, it gets automatically added to a searchable feed, which people can find using that tag. It's a common way for people to monitor a situation or interest. And since people have been including the #BlackLivesMAtter tag, in the words of activist Feminista Jones, the protests have been erased from Instagram.  ""When you check the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag, it's no longer videos, helpful information, resources, documentation of the injustice, it's rows of black screens,"" music artist Kehlani explained on her Instagram story.  People want to keep the information flowing  Blackout Tuesday gained traction from the work of music executives Jamila Thomas and Brianna Agyemang, who led an effort in the music community to pause normal business operations on June 2nd ""in observance of the long-standing racism and inequality that exists from the boardroom to the boulevard."" As the movement grew, the notion filtered down to individuals and brands who have vowed to not post any content on June 2nd in deference to the situation.  However, there's concern that while what amounts to a virtual moment of silence may be a powerful reminder to some, it comes at a time when the voices of black activists and advocates are needed the most.  Rapper Lil Nas X was critical of the movement on Twitter. ""I just really think this is the time to push as hard as ever,"" he wrote. ""I don't think the movement has ever been this powerful. we don't need to slow it down by posting nothing. we need to spread info and be as loud as ever."" However, some people have taken the call to action to mean a pause on posting about personal things or issues unrelated to Black Lives Matter or the ongoing protests rather than complete silence. Some widely shared posts about the day encourage people to refrain from self-promotion and use their presence on various platforms to uplift members of the black community instead.

The controversy over whether the Confederate flag should be taken down at the University of Virginia ended this week with a simple vote. The campus flag was taken down by the university's Board of Visitors. The University of Virginia had been the subject of a number of controversies in recent years, most recently in the aftermath of the ""Unite the Right"" protests that began in Charlottesville in 2017. The University of Virginia has been under fire since white nationalists, anti-Semites and neo-Nazis clashed with counter-protesters in the city in the wake of the ""Unite the Right"" rally. Protests were also held at the university's state Capitol in the wake of the ""Unite the Right"" rally in Charlottesville, which saw a man killed by a group of counter-protesters.
 The University of Virginia has asked that it remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from its campus. The controversial statue, which sits in the heart of Charlottesville, has drawn protests and controversy for years. It was erected in 1884 by an anti-racist activist who was angry that the statue of Confederate General Stonewall Jackson had been relocated from a park in downtown Charlottesville. The statue's removal comes amid a national debate over Confederate monuments and symbols. Here's what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door.

74,https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/23/us/aclu-california-teacher-black-lives-matter-trnd/index.html," Sacramento elementary school violated free speech by censoring Black Lives Matter posters, ACLU says"," A volunteer teaching a lesson on art and activism at Sacramento's Del Paso Manor Elementary School in September asked students to create a poster focusing on change they wanted to see in the school, according to statements from both San Juan Unified School District, which includes the school, and the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California.  The problem began when some students who created Black Lives Matter posters were told they needed to redo the assignment and didn't have their work displayed in the classroom, the ACLU says. In a letter sent Thursday, the group called out the school district for censorship, claiming the school is violating the First Amendment. What is appropriate and ""inappropriate"" The ACLU claims the teacher specifically said posters relating to Black Lives Matter were ""inappropriate for the class"" and made four students who supported the movement in their work redo their posters. The teacher targeted these students based on the content of their poster, the ACLU says, which is therefore a violation of their First Amendment rights, according to the watchdog group.  The San Juan Unified School District says these students were asked to redo their posters because the artwork was focused on large social issues, rather than issues specifically related to the school. They were asked to redo the assignment not because of the content, but because the posters didn't meet the assignment's purpose. The district said in a statement that censoring a student's assigned work because of its content ""would not be acceptable.""  Other students with posters on topics like immigration and animal cruelty were also asked to redo their posters, a representative for the district told CNN.  The ACLU, though, says the fact that other posters were also redone doesn't matter.  It's still a content-based judgement if a teacher decides that a student's BLM artwork doesn't have anything to do with the school, said Abre' Conner, a staff attorney with the ACLU of Northern California. Banning artwork based on the content is a First Amendment violation. ""It's not up to (the teacher) to then decide that Black Lives Matter is off limits for something they wanted to see change,"" she told CNN. The ACLU is representing both a student who was involved and the volunteer who was brought in to teach. The organization was originally made aware of the case by the volunteer, and then further investigated by speaking with a student whose assignment was rejected. ACLU also claiming state education code violation The ACLU isn't only charging the school with a First Amendment violation. The California Education Code also protects Black Lives Matter posters, the ACLU argues.  It states, in section 48907, ""Pupils of the public schools, including charter schools, shall have the right to exercise freedom of speech and of the press including, but not limited to, the use of bulletin boards, the distribution of printed materials or petitions, the wearing of buttons, badges, and other insignia."" As long as the speech isn't ""obscene, libelous or slanderous,"" the expression is protected, the code reads.  Under Section 201 of the code, California's public schools have an ""affirmative obligation to combat racism, sexism, and other forms of bias, and a responsibility to provide equal educational opportunity."" The ACLU claims the Black Lives Matter posters fall under this category -- and are therefore protected. The watchdog group says the teacher specifically referenced the Black Lives Matter posters in conversations with the volunteer, calling them ""inappropriate and political."" The teacher asked ""whether students were getting shot at the school and demanded answers regarding why a presentation on Black Lives Matter was relevant"" to the elementary school, the ACLU alleges. Political speech is protected by the state's education code.  He also threw away one of the student's posters, after saying the student could pick it up, the ACLU claims. ""Looking at those pieces together demonstrates that this was clearly more than asking students to redo the assignment,"" Conner said. ""It seems that there was some kind of animus against the topic (of Black Lives Matter)."" The district said in its statement that some of the assertions made by the ACLU present ""new information"" and officials are investigating the incident further."," Sacramento elementary school violated free speech by censoring Black Lives Matter posters, ACLU says. ""The ACLU is concerned that the police killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, has unleashed a wave of racial violence across the country,"" said Ali Abunimah, the ACLU of Southern California's legislative advocate. ""Free speech doesn't mean protecting the First Amendment rights of people of color, it means suppressing their voices and their power."" The ACLU of Southern California filed a lawsuit Thursday against the city of Louisville, Kentucky, where the school district is located. The lawsuit alleges the school district has a ""pattern of exercising an overwhelming power and authority"" over the curriculum and exercises of power over student conduct. ""The ACLU of Southern California is deeply concerned about the chilling effects of these policies on young people's right to free expression and assembly, and on the safety of the community at large,"" the lawsuit says. ""The ACLU is particularly concerned about the chilling effect on students of color who are already at risk for being victims of police violence and other forms of brutality. Students of color are particularly vulnerable to the effects of the school's policies."" The ACLU of Southern California also is suing the city of Louisville, Kentucky, over its school's policy of prohibiting students of color from wearing face masks. The lawsuit says the policy ""undermines the legitimate exercise of First Amendment rights guaranteed by the Constitution, and abridges their First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and assembly guaranteed by the Second Amendment.""
 ""I was very disappointed,"" he said of the police killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown. ""I felt like I was watching my back, because the police officers were very professional. They came in with the right amount of force, but they did not use a gun, they used a Taser."" He said he had no regrets about shooting the video. ""It's the right thing to do. It was the right thing to do. It was the right thing to do for the right reasons,"" he said. ""You can't take a life, you can't take a life without being affected by the consequences of that decision."" Brown was unarmed when he was shot and killed by a white police officer on August 9, 2014, in Ferguson, Missouri. Police say he was holding a BB gun when he was shot. The autopsy found that Brown was shot eight times and six of those shots were fatal. Brown's family said he was unarmed when he was shot. A grand jury decided not to indict the officer involved in the killing, but the case became a focal point in the Black Lives Matter movement. The officer who killed Brown has been fired. His gun was later used in a protest in which a black man was shot by police. The officer who killed Brown is not being charged. His attorney claims he was justified in his use of force.

75,https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/18/us/nypd-black-lives-matter-surveillance/index.html, Released NYPD emails show extensive surveillance of Black Lives Matter protesters," Undercover NYPD officers infiltrated groups of marchers and reported back to superiors with updates while also photographing activists who were seen as leaders during marches from November 2014 to January 2015.  The internal emails, obtained by attorney M.J. Williams through a Freedom of Information Law request, were first reported by the website The Appeal. Williams said the trove of emails shows the NYPD was surveilling the entire Black Lives Matter movement.  ""The assumption that the police are there to keep people like those who are participating in those protests safe is a falsehood,"" Williams said.  In response, the NYPD released a statement denying the allegations.  ""The NYPD does not interfere with Constitutionally-protected activities, and did not investigate Black Lives Matter as a political organization or movement,"" according to a statement. ""The NYPD was focused on ensuring the safety of the public, protesters and officers at these events."" Marchers took to the streets after the high-profile deaths of Garner and Brown. Garner, an unarmed man, was put in an apparent chokehold by an NYPD officer and later died on Staten Island, New York in July 2014. Brown, also unarmed, who was shot and killed by police in Ferguson, Missouri, a month later. NYPD officers came out to monitor protests as marchers took to the streets in several cities following the deaths.  In emails sent by officers that mixed in with marchers, officers sent updates on locations, sometimes even emailing high-ranking members of the department, such as Thomas Galati, chief of the NYPD's Intelligence Unit.  Images of protesters were also sent around, including one of a man holding a sign that read ""Jail Killer Cops"" and another that read, ""I Can't Breathe.""  The officers took notice of another man who wore a hoodie saying ""Cop Watch."" The mystery man was soon labeled a ""coordinator"" for the walkie-talkie he operated.  One of the emails released publicly Thursday shows an NYPD officer referring to some protesters as ""idiots."" The email came in just before 1 a.m., toward the end of an early December 2014 protest that left some participants still gathered in midtown Manhattan. ""Still idiots up in Times Square. We'll let you know,"" the email reads. Other emails sent in early December 2014 show NYPD officers discussing spotting protesters with possible ""swords and masks"" and referring to them as ""ninjas."" The NYPD said its tactics were routine.  ""The communications reflected in the emails describe the movements of large groups of protesters with a focus on preventing violence or the mass disruption of traffic,"" according to the NYPD statement. ""These are responsibilities that fit squarely within the guidelines that dictate the NYPD's lawful activities during major demonstrations that may involve disorder or impact the safety of New Yorkers."" Williams countered by saying the images collected were unnecessary.  ""They're armed and collecting data about people who are identifying themselves as people who are critical of the police and they're retaining those records,"" Williams said.  Meanwhile, Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a news conference that he was concerned at the notion the NYPD may have been surveilling the Black Lives Matter movement, which he described as ""nonviolent."" ""I have no understanding of why there would need to be any monitoring so I will of course wait for the details,"" de Blasio said. ""But they are not a security risk in any way, shape or form, so I don't know why that monitoring would have taken place."""," Released NYPD emails show extensive surveillance of Black Lives Matter protesters, protesters say New York City police are increasingly using surveillance video to determine who is a criminal threat and who should be arrested, according to emails obtained by The New York Times. Police have sent out memos to field offices instructing them to monitor demonstrations. But the emails show that the NYPD is not without its own issues with the process of determining who is a criminal threat. ""We have been out in the streets for the last few days, and have been out in the street with people's faces on cameras, and we have been out in the street with cameras recording people's actions and video. This is not the way we do things in this city,"" a top NYPD official wrote to another NYPD official. ""The way we do things here is with cameras in the street and on the police cars. We are not out there with cameras because we don't want to jeopardize our relationship with our communities, and we don't want to be seen as being outside of it."" The memos, first reported by The New York Times, raise concerns that the NYPD is attempting to move beyond its reliance on police cars and start using technology to determine who is a criminal threat and who should be arrested. They also raise concerns that the NYPD is becoming less transparent about the surveillance it conducts. ""We have been out in the streets and have seen people's faces on cameras,"" one officer wrote in an email. ""I am not sure what the purpose of these cameras is. Is it to record and evaluate the actions of police officers? Or is it to protect the lives of innocent bystanders? If it is protecting innocent bystanders, I am concerned about it."" The memos also raise questions about the role of the independent monitor, a police force that has been criticized for its inability to hold officers accountable. The independent monitor, a former officer who is not employed by the NYPD, is tasked with reviewing police conduct and whether there are patterns of excessive or deadly force. The process is supposed to be transparent and open, and he or she has been criticized for being stonewalled by police and the NYPD. In one email, a top NYPD official complained that he had been forced to hand over videos from his body camera. ""We are not allowed to release any of the videos except to say that we have made an effort to release them under the Freedom of Information Act,"" the email states. The memos come amid a national debate over the role of police in American society and the use of force. The New York Police Benevolent Association is demanding the resignation of NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill, who is their leader, and Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has said that the city is in the midst of a ""tough talk"" against racial profiling.

Moye, whose February 2017 arrest video went viral after he tried to snatch a Confederate flag from a protester in downtown Charleston, was later pronounced dead at that hospital, police and his family said.  His body was found on a largely residential street, in front of an auto repair shop. His mountain bike, its right side ""covered in blood,"" was found across the street, the report said.  The officer found a circuitous blood trail that led from Moye's body to a spent bullet fragment in a grassy area four or five blocks away, the report said, adding that there are cameras near the location of Moye's body and near the bullet fragment's location. The incident report doesn't say whether the cameras captured anything useful to investigators, but they did collect the bullet, a hat and DNA evidence at the scene. Though the police report doesn't mention Moye dying, his family wrote on a verified GoFundMe account that he died from blood loss, and a New Orleans Police Department spokesman confirmed his death.  ""An adult black male, identified as Mr. Muhiydin Moye, sustained a gunshot wound to the thigh in a shooting incident that occurred shortly before 1:30 am on February 6th.

We don't have many details, but will update as soon as we do.""  Moye also used the last name d'Baha, according to his family.  Weaver did not immediately return a CNN email, but GoFundMe confirmed the legitimacy of the account seeking funds to transport Moye's body back to Charleston, where a funeral is planned. As of Wednesday afternoon, the fundraiser had garnered triple its goal of $7,500.  On February 22, 2017, Bree Newsome -- the woman arrested for scaling a 30-foot flagpole and removing a Confederate flag at the South Carolina statehouse in 2015 -- was addressing a crowd that included members of Black Lives Matter as well as protesters from the state's Secessionist Party.  As CNN affiliate WCSC broadcast live from in front of the theater where Newsome spoke, Moye darted behind the station's correspondent, hurtled through yellow police tape and grabbed the flagpole of a protester holding aloft the Confederate flag.  The protester held strong and Moye took off, only to be tackled a few feet away by several police officers. He was charged with disorderly conduct, according to WCSC.  Moye later told The Washington Post his motive was to ""help (the people protesting Newsome's speech) understand what it is to meet a real resistance, to meet people that aren't scared."" According to CNN affiliate WCIV, the Black Lives Matter Charleston activist was known for organizing civil rights rallies, and for demanding transparency and public oversight of law enforcement after North Charleston police Officer Michael Slager was caught on camera fatally shooting Walter Scott in the back as he fled.  Before the damning video of Slager opening fire became public, Feidin Santana actually sent a screenshot of the footage to Moye and BLM Charleston, who connected Santana with Scott's family, Moye told CNN during a 2016 interview.  ""So we had the truth before police had the truth,"" Moye said. ""When it was time for us to organize and step up to the plate for our protest we didn't have the kind of indecision and we didn't have the kind of confusion that I think other places have had to deal with. 'We need the video; we want to see what happened.' That wasn't our demand. Our demand was going right to remedy."" Many of Moye's fellow activists took to social media to mourn the 32-year-old.  ""Go well, knowing that the work you've done speaks for you,"" Charleston activist Leah Suarez posted on Instagram. ""Rest in power, knowing that what you sought, you already were, and will continue to be."" Deray Mckesson, a staunch supporter of the BLM movement, wrote on Twitter that Moye's death was ""quite a loss."" ""He was such a force and an incredible guy,"" Mckesson tweeted. "," Black Lives Matter activist fatally shot while biking late at night in New Orleans ""I think it's a sad day when a police officer is killed in a police encounter, especially when he or she is unarmed,"" he said. ""It's something that we have to fight against.""
 It's a good thing that the protests are mostly peaceful. It would be a sad day, though, if they weren't. And in many cases, that's exactly what's happening. This weekend, a Dallas cop was killed by a sniper who had been drinking.  A protester was killed by a man who had been taunting her for months. In Chicago, a man was killed by a man who had been drinking and driving. And in New York City, a police officer was killed by a man who had been drinking and smoking.  And in other cities, people are dying in the streets and their city is being swamped by police officers and protesters. Some of those deaths were preventable, some were not. And it's all happening in the name of ""justice."" On Sunday night, protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, turned into peaceful protesters, and police responded with tear gas and rubber bullets. But in many places, it looked like things were going to get worse before they got better. The same protesters who were protesting are now demanding that the police officers be charged with his death. And they're not happy about it. ""It's not just about the police being held accountable. It's about the people getting out of their cars and not being targeted for their race, their religion, their gender, for their disability,"" says Brittany Covington, a protester who lives in Ferguson. She says she doesn't see how it's any different than what happened in Ferguson. ""The police are not above the law, they're above the Constitution, and they need to be held accountable for their actions,"" she says. 'A series of missteps' The protests in Ferguson are a perfect storm of missteps for the police. One, the protests are largely peaceful, and the police are making a lot of noise. Two, the protests are largely peaceful. And three, the police have made a lot of noise. But the protests have also cost thousands of dollars in damages. A grand jury has been empaneled to investigate the shooting of Michael Brown, the deaths of other black men by police, and the ongoing controversy over how police handle and respond to protests. All that's on top of the fact that protesters have been shot and killed by police. This weekend, the protests were even more tense as some protesters were arrested. Demonstrators in Boston were seen being led by police into a police precinct.  In Los Angeles, protesters were met with a mix of tear gas and pepper spray. In New York City, police used batons and plastic bullets to disperse a crowd of about 20,000. And in Chicago, police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse a crowd of about 1,000. All that's going to add up to a much larger number of deaths in the streets this weekend than the police report says.
 It was a political decision. It was a moral choice. It was a choice between two futures. In a city that's already seen its share of violence, the mayor decided to make the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown a symbol of change. He decided to send a message to young people who had been disillusioned by the violence that had rocked the city over the past few months. And he chose to send a clear message to the black community that he was not here to be a bystander. ""We all have the power to change the course of events that we see happening in our city,"" he said. ""I'm asking you to take a second to reflect on the choices you have made today, and then reflect on those choices again."" ""I will be the first to say that this choice was not easy,"" he said. ""But I'm asking you to",794

""We can and we must improve our educational system to be more culturally competent and ever more inclusive to the historically marginalized and oppressed."" The flag-raising, which was attended by students, faculty and neighbors, was among Black History Month events designed to start conversations about racism and race equity in education. The idea was brought to the school board last year by a student-led group called the Racial Justice Alliance. If all goes according to plan, the banner -- which spells out ""Black Lives Matter"" in white letters against a dark field -- will stay aloft all month.  McRaith also invited local police to the ceremony so they could see the gesture was in no way intended as an attack on them, he told WPTZ.  ""Thank you for understanding that the decision to fly the Black Lives Matter flag this month at Montpelier High School is not anti-police. It is anti-bias,"" McRaith said during the ceremony. ""Thank you for understanding that we reject any purported violence associated with Black Lives Matter and embrace the message of equity for all."" The school has gotten some angry phone calls, emails and social media posts criticizing its decision, McRaith said, while others have praised the decision.  ""We all, as Vermonters, should be proud of what we are doing in our schools when we can have our youth be this responsible,"" state Rep. Kevin Christie said of the gesture."," Why a high school that's just 5% black is raising the Black Lives Matter flag  A high school that's just 5% black, and who's really trying to do the right thing? The answer, of course, is no. The NAACP has long been a target of white conservatives who don't want the organization to be seen as supporting black causes. But in recent years, they've changed their tune. They've become more vocal in supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, which has become a top-tier national movement with high-profile celebrities like Beyoncé and Laverne Cox. Some of this has to do with the fact that they're raising money for Black Lives Matter. ""It's not just about the politics of it. It's about the people's right to be heard,"" said Erica Wilson, a founding member of the NAACP's Board of Directors. ""There's a lot of white people who are afraid of that kind of activism."" A lot of the white backlash against the Black Lives Matter movement has to do with the fact that they want to be seen as the allies of black Americans. And many white conservatives don't want to be seen as being racist or bigots. ""It's not just about the politics of it. It's about the people's right to be heard,"" said Wilson, who is black. ""It's about the people's right to know the truth. And we have to be clear:",272

Jackson wrote. ""Therefore, all claims against 'Black Lives Matter' must be dismissed because social movements lack the capacity to be sued."" The suing Baton Rouge police officer, who remained unnamed in the lawsuit, said he was hit by concrete or rock-like objects while responding to a demonstration led by DeRay Mckesson for Black Lives Matter and had ""several serious injuries,"" according to court documents.  Protests, vigils and memorials  sprang up nationwide after the shooting of Sterling by police outside a Baton Rouge convenience store. In a graphic cellphone video that was widely shared on social media, police officers can be seen on top of the African-American man before shots were fired.  The injured officer said Mckesson and Black Lives Matter were liable for his injuries because they were negligent and should have known the protests would turn to riots and become violent. Mckesson was exercising his constitutional right to demonstrate, the judge ruled, and he cannot be held liable for the conduct of other protesters.      ""All of this highlights the need for deep, deep changes in the city of Baton Rouge."" Mckesson told CNN. ""It is not a new tactic that people try to use the courts to silence activists and organizers. I am happy that the judge dismissed the lawsuit and understood I had no part in the officer's injuries."" A second lawsuit, filed on behalf of another anonymous police officer who was injured in a July 17, 2016, shooting that killed three Baton Rouge officers, lists Mckesson, Black Lives Matter and others as defendants. That case is before the same judge. Federal prosecutors said earlier this year that there isn't enough evidence to charge the two officers involved in Sterling's death. "," Judge rules Black Lives Matter movement can't be sued, dismisses case. But some in the black community feel the same way. ""This is a huge victory for the Black Lives Matter movement, but it also comes at a huge cost for the people who are already suffering,"" said Jamelle Bouie, a prominent black activist and the founder of Black Lives Matter. ""The civil rights movement took on a whole new meaning when these laws were passed. Now they're being used by police to harass and terrorize peaceful protesters. It's no longer enough to be a black activist and a civil rights activist. You have to be a criminal and a terrorist."" It's the latest in a series of high-profile cases that have brought attention to the plight of the black community. A civil rights investigation into the fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014 resulted in the release of dashcam video showing the fatal encounter. A year later, a grand jury in New York declined to indict a white police officer in the death of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who was allegedly choked by a white police officer. The case sparked protests across the nation and a national conversation about the role of police in society. ""It's a win for the people, but it's also a win for the police officers,"" Bouie said. ""It's a win for everyone involved, but especially the officers.""

79,https://www.cnn.com/2017/07/09/us/lawsuit-black-lives-matter-baton-rouge/index.html, Baton Rouge officer sues Black Lives Matter over 2016 ambush of cops," The July 17, 2016, attack by gunman Gavin Long claimed the lives of two police officers and a sheriff's deputy and wounded two deputies and an officer. Lawyers for one of the wounded law enforcement officers filed the complaint Friday in US District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana against various arms of the Black Lives Matter movement and leaders including DeRay Mckesson and Johnetta Elzie. The complaint alleges Black Lives Matter and its leaders are responsible for the shooting because they ""incited the violence against police in retaliation for the death (sic) of black men shot by police,"" and ""did nothing to dissuade the ongoing violence and injury to police.""  ""In fact, they justified the violence as necessary to the movement and war,"" the complaint says. The person who filed the lawsuit is named in the complaint only as Officer John Doe Smith. It says he is 42 with two children and is permanently disabled as a result of the numerous injuries he suffered in the ambush. Smith, the complaint says, was shot through his abdomen, left shoulder and left side of his head. The shot to his abdomen ""tore up his intestines,"" requiring 16 surgeries and causing recurring infections. Medical staff must attend to the exit wound daily, it says. The shot to Smith's head almost tore off his left ear, which needed to be sewn back on, the complaint says. His skull was shattered and he lost brain matter on the left side, in an area controlling communication. His left eye stays mostly closed with the eyeball turned outward, it says. ""John Doe Police Officer was strong and vibrant and he has been struggling everyday, fighting to live, and fighting to get better,"" the complaint says. It seeks at least $75,000 in compensatory damages. It is not clear why the officer filed the complaint under a pseudonym. Donna Grodner, the attorney for the officer who filed the suit, told CNN she wasn't authorized to speak about the case. The Baton Rouge victims In the attack last July, Long waited for police near a Baton Rouge convenience store that was known as a favorite stop for patrol officers.  Armed with a rifle, he fatally shot Officers Matthew Gerald, 41, and Montrell Jackson, 32, outside the store as soon as he saw them. Sheriff's Deputy Brad Garafola, who apparently was responding to reports of a man with a rifle, heard the shots and took cover, but then ran to help one of the downed officers. That's when Long opened fire, killing Garafola. Long then shot Officer Chad Montgomery, who had pulled up in front of the building. The bullet grazed his head. In a nearby parking lot, Sheriff's Deputy Nicholas Tullier, then 41, was in his cruiser to run the tag on Long's car when the gunman emerged from the woods and opened fire, shooting as he walked toward the vehicle. Tullier was shot once in the head and twice in the abdomen and was in a coma for months. Long took shots at another arriving deputy, Bruce Simmons, 51, shattering the bone from his elbow to his shoulder. Simmons now has a titanium rod in his arm. SWAT officers then arrived on scene and shot Long in the leg, causing him to fall to the ground. As Long reached for his weapon, five SWAT officers fired, killing him. Lawsuit: Black Lives Matter 'declared war' on police The complaint describes in detail numerous protests that erupted across the country over several years, spurred by the shooting deaths of black men at the hands of police, and lists instances of violence, looting and vandalism at protests in Ferguson, Missouri; Baltimore; McKinney, Texas; Dallas and Baton Rouge. The suit notes Mckesson's involvement in Black Lives Matter, and it points to his participation in the protests and his appearances in the media when he was introduced as a leader of the movement or a protest organizer. When violence erupted at some of the protests, the complaint says, Mckesson and other Black Lives Matter leaders ""failed to disavow the violence and urged its followers that violence was part of revolution,"" the complaint says. ""By embracing and supporting violence in protest that could have been conducted peacefully, BLM declared a virtual war on police,"" it says. When reached for comment, Mckesson told CNN, ""This is the second lawsuit an officer has filed against me from Baton Rouge. ... I'm confident it has no merit."" Elzie had no comment, and other defendants from Black Lives Matter could not be immediately reached for comment. Baton Rouge ambush 'mimicked' Dallas attack Mckesson and Elzie were present for protests in Baton Rouge in July 2016 held in response to the officer-involved shooting deaths of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge and Philando Castile near Minneapolis earlier that month.  The suit says they came to protest and ""to incite others to violence against police and other law enforcement officers."" Mckesson was arrested during the protests on July 9, though he told CNN days later the arrest was unlawful because he was complying with police requests to move back at the time. The lawsuit also says Long's actions when he killed the Baton Rouge officers ""followed and mimicked those of another BLM activist who killed several officers in Dallas just days earlier."" Five Dallas police officers were killed and seven others wounded on July 7 last year when a gunman opened fire on them during protests against the killings of Sterling and Castile. Investigators identified the Dallas gunman as Micah Xavier Johnson, 25, a military veteran who had served in Afghanistan. Johnson told police negotiators during a standoff that he was upset about recent police shootings and wanted to kill white people, especially white officers, the police chief said. His online history showed he visited and liked several websites dedicated to Black Lives Matter. Johnson was killed after a standoff with police. Long, who acted alone in the shooting, traveled to Baton Rouge after stopping in Dallas shortly after the shooting to get revenge for the recent killings, the complaint says, suggesting that Black Lives Matter encouraged the behavior."," Baton Rouge officer sues Black Lives Matter over 2016 ambush of cops

The city's police chief says he's filing a lawsuit against the city, its police department and its former chief.

In a lawsuit filed Friday, the city of Ferguson and the city of St. Louis say they are seeking class-action status in a class-action lawsuit. The suit claims the city has failed to adequately train, equip and equip its police officers with body cameras, body cameras that record officer-involved shootings, as required by state and federal law. Ferguson and St. Louis say the suits are without merit. ""This is a blatant attempt to take away our right to due process, and to put us in a legal class where we are forced to defend ourselves against baseless and frivolous lawsuits,"" Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said in a statement. ""We will vigorously defend our officers' rights to wear body cameras, and we will vigorously defend our officers' rights to have their videos recorded."" Attorney General Mike Ferguson says the suit is ""basically just a political stunt."" He says the state's attorney general is investigating the city's response to the shooting of Michael Brown, the unarmed black teenager who sparked outrage in Ferguson and elsewhere after he was killed by a white police officer. Ferguson and St. Louis say they're seeking more than $50 million in damages.

 Police say they will put up a ""Black Lives Matter"" flag in the same location. CNN affiliate KATV-TV reported the White House is also putting up a ""Black Lives Matter"" flag on the South Lawn. ""The flag controversy is a political statement and not a statement about what we stand for. We are working with local officials to find a way to bring awareness to this important conversation and ensure that the flag controversy does not distract from our work to make sure all lives matter,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in a statement.
 ""I'm going to keep talking about it, but we're not going to do that here,"" Missouri Rep. John Lewis said. ""We're going to take a stand. We're going to march, and we're going to protest.""  The White House statement came as demonstrators in several cities converged on the White House to protest the deaths of unarmed black men by police. Protests were also held across the nation. In New York, thousands of demonstrators gathered at a protest site in Manhattan, while in Chicago, thousands marched from the UIC Pavilion to the White House. Demonstrators also took to the streets in Atlanta, Baton Rouge, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, Minneapolis and Seattle.  In Washington, protesters gathered near the White House and in front of the Capitol building. CNN affiliate WTOP reported demonstrators held a ""Black Lives Matter"" banner and chanted slogans like ""Say Her Name"" and ""Black lives matter."" In Baton Rouge, demonstrators marched through downtown and downtown to a park where they were met with chants of ""No justice, no peace!"" and ""No KKK, no KKK."" ""We are all a bunch of people here trying to do the right thing, and I think that we can all agree that the right thing is not being done,"" Baton Rouge resident A.C. ""A.C."" Wilson said. In Seattle, thousands of demonstrators took to the streets. ""Seattle is home to the Black Lives Matter movement. We wanted to show support for our community and fight racism and police brutality in our own backyard,"" the group said on its website. In Miami, hundreds of demonstrators held a protest at the same spot where demonstrators were met with clashes with police. In New York, hundreds of protesters marched through Manhattan, chanting ""Black lives matter."" In Chicago, about 150 protesters marched from the scene of a shooting to a park near the White House. The march ended at a park near the Lincoln Memorial. In New Orleans, hundreds of demonstrators marched through the city's downtown core, according to the National Lawyers Guild. In Boston, protesters gathered at the intersection of Boylston and 11th streets. Boston police said they were planning to deploy National Guardsmen to the scene. In Atlanta, demonstrators in the city's city limits were met with a large police presence, CNN affiliate WSB reports. ""Atlanta police say they will deploy at least a half-dozen National Guard units to the city's downtown core as part of a ""temporary"" deployment in response to protests that continue,"" the city's mayor said. ""The National Guard will remain in the city until a later date,"" he added.

On Monday, lawyers announced a $3 million settlement between the Castile family and St. Anthony, Minnesota, the city that employed the officer acquitted in Castile's death.  While officer convictions are rare, killings that have spawned ""Black Lives Matter"" protests have led to notable outcomes -- including settlements to stave off civil lawsuits and changes to police policy. Here's how some of the most high-profile cases have turned out: Philando Castile, 32 Date of death: July 6, 2016 Where: Falcon Heights, Minnesota  What happened: St. Anthony police Officer Jeronimo Yanez pulled Castile over during a traffic stop. Castile told the officer he had a firearm on him, which he was permitted to carry. Castile reached for something and Yanez shot him five times. During the Facebook Live video, Castile's girlfriend said he was reaching for his license; the officer later said he thought Castile was reaching for his gun.  The outcomes: Yanez was acquitted of second-degree manslaughter, but the city of St. Anthony settled with Castile's mother for $3 million.  ""The settlement will be paid through the City's coverage with the League of Minnesota Cities Insurance Trust. No taxpayer monies from the City of St. Anthony Village will be used to fund this settlement,"" a joint statement from the city and the Castile family said.  By reaching a settlement, the Castile family and St. Anthony avoid ""a federal civil rights lawsuit which may have taken years to work its way through the courts exacerbating the suffering of the family and of the community,"" the statement said.  Jordan Edwards, 15 Date of death: April 29, 2017 Where: Balch Springs, Texas What happened: Officers responded to a house party after reports of underage drinking. Police spotted a car leaving with five people inside.  Officer Roy Oliver fired into the car with a rifle, fatally shooting Jordan, who was sitting in the front passenger seat. Police Chief Jonathan Haber initially said the car had been moving ""aggressively"" toward officers. Later, Haber corrected himself and said body camera footage showed the car was driving forward -- away from the officers.  The outcomes: Haber fired the officer, saying Oliver ""violated several departmental policies."" Oliver was arrested in May and charged with first degree murder. Meanwhile, Jordan's classmates at Mesquite High School grieved the loss of the beloved football player and straight-A student.  Alton Sterling, 37 Date of death: July 5, 2016 Where: Baton Rouge, Louisiana What happened: Sterling was selling CDs outside a convenience store when police received a call of a man with a gun. Cellphone video showed police tackling Sterling and pinning him to the ground before Sterling was shot. Police said Sterling was reaching for a gun. The outcomes: Federal prosecutors said they didn't have enough evidence to file charges against Baton Rouge police officers Blane Salamoni and Howie Lake II.  Minutes later, the Louisiana attorney general announced the state will launch an investigation to see whether the officers should face state criminal charges.  But Sterling's death has sparked change in the city. Baton Rouge Mayor Sharon Weston Broome said $2 million will be spent securing body cameras for the entire police force. On top of that, the city's police training manual will be revised, and officers will receive training in implicit bias, the mayor said. Walter Scott, 50 Date of death: April 4, 2015 Where: North Charleston, South Carolina  What happened: Officer Michael Slager pulled Scott over for a broken taillight. Scott bolted out of his car, though it's not clear why. His family attorney speculated that Scott's flight stemmed from his unpaid child support ""and a fear of maybe going back (to jail).""  As Scott ran away from the officer, a witness captured video of Slager shooting Scott several times in the back.  The outcomes: Slager was fired and indicted on a state murder charge and federal charges, including misleading investigators and excessive use of force.  The state murder trial ended in a mistrial. But Slager admitted to using excessive force as part of a federal plea deal.  In exchange for his guilty plea on one of the federal counts -- punishable by up to life in prison -- two other federal charges and state charges were dropped.  Scott's death also led to a statewide change: the South Carolina Legislature passed a bill mandating the use of police body cameras.  And the North Charleston City Council agreed to a $6.5 million settlement with Scott's family. Trayvon Martin, 17 Date of death: February 26, 2012 Where: Sanford, Florida What happened: Martin was walking from a convenience store back to the home of his father's fiancée. Neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman spotted him from his car and called 911, reporting ""a real suspicious guy.""  ""This guy looks like he's up to no good, or he's on drugs or something,"" Zimmerman told a dispatcher. ""It's raining, and he's just walking around."" A scuffle broke out, but there were no direct witnesses. Zimmerman claimed Martin attacked him, hitting him in the nose and knocking him onto the pavement. Zimmerman said he then took out his gun and shot Martin in self defense.   But critics said Zimmerman was unjustified in confronting the unarmed teen, especially since Zimmerman didn't heed a police dispatcher's advice to stop following him. The outcomes: Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder but was found not guilty. The acquittal ignited protests across the country, and the ""Black Lives Matter"" movement gained national prominence.  The case also led to the firing of Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee, who was criticized for not arresting Zimmerman after Martin was killed.  Why this verdict? Five things that led to Zimmerman's acquittal Eric Garner, 43 Date of death: July 17, 2014  Where: New York City  What happened: Police tried to arrest Garner in front of a store for allegedly selling cigarettes illegally. Garner raised both hands and told officers not to touch him. Seconds later, Officer Daniel Pantaleo grabbed the 350-pound man in a chokehold and pulled him to the sidewalk, rolling him onto his stomach. The New York Police Department prohibits the use of chokeholds.  Garner, who had asthma, repeatedly said, ""I can't breathe! I can't breathe!"" while several officers restrained him on the ground. Police said he suffered a heart attack and died en route to a hospital. The outcomes: A grand jury declined to indict Pantaleo, sparking protests and ""die-ins.""  Garner's death also spurred a new protest slogan: ""I can't breathe,"" some of the last words Garner said before he died. Several professional athletes wore shirts saying ""I can't breathe"" in silent protest.  Pantaleo offered his condolences to Garner's family and said he never intended to hurt Garner. The police union defended Pantaleo, saying he just wanted to take Garner into custody after the suspect resisted.  New York City eventually settled with Garner's family for $5.9 million. City Comptroller Scott Stringer said the settlement ""acknowledges the tragic nature of Mr. Garner's death,"" but ""the city has not admitted liability."" Michael Brown, 18 Date of death: August 9, 2014 Where: Ferguson, Missouri  What happened: Brown was walking with a friend in the middle of a street when Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson approached them and told them to walk on the sidewalk.  After that, the narratives split. Authorities said Brown attacked the officer in his car and tried to take his gun. Other witnesses said the teenager was surrendering, his hands in the air to show he was unarmed, when the officer opened fire.  Documents showed that Wilson fired his gun 12 times. What happened when Michael Brown met Officer Darren Wilson   The outcomes: A grand jury decided not to indict Wilson -- leading to heated and sometimes violent protests in Ferguson and across the country.   A few days later, Wilson resigned from the Ferguson Police Department.  Despite the lack of criminal charges, the Michael Brown case launched a series of reforms. A federal investigation revealed a pattern of abuse by Ferguson's mostly white police force against the city's majority black residents.  The Justice Department found that ""many officers"" apparently viewed some of the city's black residents ""less as constituents to be protected than as potential offenders and sources of revenue."" Black residents were ticketed and cited for minor violations at a higher rate than white residents, the Justice Department said. The investigation also found a spate of racist emails sent by some police and court officials.   Ferguson police report: The most shocking parts After the scathing Justice Department report, Ferguson police Chief Thomas Jackson resigned, and the Justice Department sued Ferguson to force police reform in the city. Freddie Gray, 25  Date of death: April 19, 2015, seven days after he was injured Where: Baltimore What happened: An officer on bike patrol made eye contact with Gray, and Gray fled. Police later found a knife in Gray's pocket and arrested him on a weapons charge.   Officers handcuffed Gray and put him in a police van. At some point, Gray suffered a fatal spinal cord injury. He died seven days later.  Gray's death prompted riots, looting and arson in Baltimore.  The outcomes: Six Baltimore police officers, including three black and three white officers, were charged in connection with Gray's death.  Three officers were acquitted: Edward Nero, a bike officer involved in the initial police encounter with Gray; Caesar Goodson, who drove the van; and Lt. Brian Rice, the highest-ranking officer charged in connection with Gray's death. Prosecutors dropped charges against the three remaining officers: Garrett Miller; Alicia White and William Porter. Aside from the criminal trials, Baltimore officials approved a $6.4 million deal to settle all civil claims tied to Gray's death.  The settlement did not ""represent any judgment"" on whether the officers were guilty or innocent, Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said.  ""This settlement represents an opportunity to bring closure to the Gray family, the community and the city."""," 'Black Lives Matter' cases: What happened after controversial police killings of unarmed black men? 'I've been called all the names in the book' The NAACP's calls for a boycott of Target have been met with a chorus of protest. The company said it will not sell clothing or accessories made by the retailer, which has also been criticized for its support of Black Lives Matter. ""Target is a target, and we're not going to stand for it,"" the company tweeted. ""We will not stand by while others are harmed or killed because of the color of their skin. Black lives matter."" But many Black people see the boycott as a symbol of the growing divide between the Black community and mainstream America. ""It's becoming increasingly clear that this is a very American thing to boycott and protest,"" said Adam Clayton, a political science professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. ""It's a way of saying 'I'm not buying your product.' "" This isn't the first time the NAACP has faced backlash over the Black Lives Matter movement. The organization has faced backlash over the ""unarmed black man"" movement, which has been criticized for its call for the end of violence against African-Americans. In the 1980s, the NAACP stopped selling T-shirts that said ""Black Lives Matter"" after protests against police brutality.
 The decision to release the video sparked outrage and protests in several cities. The video shows a police officer holding a black man down on the ground by the neck and pulling him to the ground with a police baton. The video was widely circulated and picked up by other news outlets. In Ferguson, Missouri, protesters were out in force Saturday night and into Sunday morning. ""I was on the ground all night, and I still got my camera. And I still got my phone,"" protester Lina Taylor told CNN. Taylor was in Ferguson when she witnessed the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown by white police officer Darren Wilson. ""I just wanted to see him, I didn't want to see him,"" Taylor said. ""I just wanted to see him. I didn't want to see him."" Brown's death sparked days of protests in Ferguson and across the nation. In New York City, thousands of demonstrators rallied in front of the NYPD's headquarters. Some carried signs that said, ""I can't breathe"" and ""Black lives matter."" In Chicago, protesters held a ""No justice, no peace"" protest, with some chanting ""Black lives matter"" as they marched. In Los Angeles, protesters marched to the White House, chanting ""No justice, no peace"" and ""Black lives matter."" In Miami, protesters marched from MacArthur Park to the Florida International University. In Los Angeles, they chanted ""No justice, no peace"" and ""Say her name."" In New York City, protesters marched from the steps of the Brooklyn Bridge to the New York Police Department headquarters. Some carried signs that read ""I can't breathe"" and ""My name is Maya Angelou."" In Los Angeles, protesters marched from the steps of the Brooklyn Bridge to the Police Department headquarters. In Washington, D.C., they marched from the US Capitol to the Lincoln Tunnel. In Boston, they marched from the Lincoln Tunnel to the Lincoln Tunnel Museum. In Philadelphia, they marched from the Capitol to the American Museum of Natural History. In Chicago, they marched from the US Capitol to the Police Department headquarters.

In Atlanta, they marched from the city's Lakeview neighborhood to the city's Metro-North Railroad station. In St. Louis, they marched from the intersection of 13th and St. Louis to the spot where Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer. In Baton Rouge, they marched from the site of a protest where a grand jury decided not to indict the officer involved in the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown. In St. Louis, they marched from the spot where 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot by police. In New York City, they marched from the Brooklyn Bridge to the Brooklyn Museum.

Another officer has been fired for killing Jordan Edwards, a 15-year-old honor student. And yet another officer pleaded guilty after shooting Walter Scott as the 50-year-old was running away.  While officer convictions are rare, such killings have spawned ""Black Lives Matter"" protests and have led to notable changes -- including reforms to police policy. Here's how some of the most high-profile cases have turned out: Jordan Edwards, 15 Date of death: April 29, 2017 Where: Balch Springs, Texas What happened: Officers responded to a house party after reports of underage drinking. Police spotted a car leaving with five people inside -- including Jordan in the front passenger seat.  At first, Police Chief Jonathan Haber said the car was moving ""aggressively"" toward officers, and officer Roy Oliver fired into the car with a rifle.  But on Monday, Haber corrected himself and said body camera footage showed the car was driving forward -- away from the officers.  The outcomes: Haber fired the officer Tuesday, saying Oliver ""violated several departmental policies."" Meanwhile, Jordan's classmates at Mesquite High School are grieving the loss of the beloved football player and straight-A student.  Alton Sterling, 37 Date of death: July 5, 2016 Where: Baton Rouge, Louisiana What happened: Sterling was selling CDs outside a convenience store when police received a call of a man with a gun. Cellphone video showed police tackling Sterling and pinning him to the ground before Sterling was shot. But police said Sterling was reaching for a gun. The outcomes: On Wednesday, federal prosecutors said they didn't have enough evidence to file charges against Baton Rouge police officers Blane Salamoni and Howie Lake II.  Minutes later, the Louisiana attorney general announced the state will launch an investigation to see whether the officers should face state criminal charges.  But Sterling's death has already yielded change. Baton Rouge Mayor Sharon Weston Broome said $2 million will be spent securing body cameras for the entire police force. On top of that, the city's police training manual will be revised, and officers will receive training in implicit bias, the mayor said. Walter Scott, 50 Date of death: April 4, 2015 Where: North Charleston, South Carolina  What happened: Officer Michael Slager pulled Scott over for a broken taillight. Scott bolted out of his car, though it's not clear why. His family attorney speculated that Scott's flight stemmed from his unpaid child support ""and a fear of maybe going back (to jail).""  As Scott ran away from the officer, a witness captured video of Slager shooting Scott several times in the back.  The outcomes: Slager was fired and indicted for a state murder charge and federal charges, including misleading investigators and excessive use of force.  The state murder trial ended in a mistrial. But on Tuesday, Slager admitted to using excessive force as part of a federal plea deal.  In exchange for his guilty plea for one of the federal counts -- punishable by up to life in prison -- two other federal charges and state charges were dropped.  Scott's death also led to a statewide change: The South Carolina Legislature passed a bill mandating the use of police body cameras.  And the North Charleston City Council agreed to a $6.5 million settlement with Scott's family. Trayvon Martin, 17 Date of death: February 26, 2012 Where: Sanford, Florida What happened: Martin was walking from a convenience store back to the home of his father's fiancée. Neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman spotted him from his car and called 911, reporting ""a real suspicious guy.""  ""This guy looks like he's up to no good, or he's on drugs or something,"" Zimmerman told a dispatcher. ""It's raining, and he's just walking around."" A scuffle broke out, but there were no direct witnesses. Zimmerman claimed Martin attacked him, hitting him in the nose and knocking him onto the pavement. Zimmerman said he then took out his gun and shot Martin in self defense.   But critics said Zimmerman was unjustified in confronting the unarmed teen, especially since Zimmerman didn't heed a police dispatcher's advice to stop following him. The outcomes: Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder but was found not guilty. The acquittal ignited protests across the country, and the ""Black Lives Matter"" movement gained national prominence.  The case also led to the firing of Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee, who was criticized for not arresting Zimmerman after Martin was killed.  Why this verdict? Five things that led to Zimmerman's acquittal Eric Garner, 43 Date of death: July 17, 2014  Where: New York City  What happened: Police tried to arrest Garner in front of a store for allegedly selling cigarettes illegally. Garner raised both hands and told officers not to touch him. Seconds later, Officer Daniel Pantaleo grabbed the 350-pound man in a chokehold and pulled him to the sidewalk, rolling him onto his stomach. The New York Police Department prohibits the use of chokeholds.  Garner, who had asthma, repeatedly said, ""I can't breathe! I can't breathe!"" while several officers restrained him on the ground. Police said he suffered a heart attack and died en route to a hospital. The outcomes: A grand jury declined to indict Pantaleo, sparking protests and ""die-ins.""  Garner's death also spurred a new protest slogan: ""I can't breathe,"" referring to some of his final words before he died. Several professional athletes wore shirts saying ""I can't breathe"" in silent protest.  Pantaleo offered his condolences to Garner's family and said he never intended to hurt Garner. The police union defended Pantaleo, saying he just wanted to take Garner into custody after the suspect resisted.  New York City eventually settled with Garner's family for $5.9 million. City Comptroller Scott Stringer said the settlement ""acknowledges the tragic nature of Mr. Garner's death,"" but ""the city has not admitted liability."" Michael Brown, 18 Date of death: August 9, 2014 Where: Ferguson, Missouri  What happened: Brown was walking with a friend in the middle of a street when Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson approached them and told them to walk on the sidewalk.  After that, the narratives split. Authorities said Brown had attacked the officer in his car and tried to take his gun. Others said the teenager was surrendering, his hands in the air to show he was unarmed, when the officer opened fire.  Documents showed that Wilson fired his gun 12 times. What happened when Michael Brown met Officer Darren Wilson   The outcomes: A grand jury decided not to indict Wilson -- leading to heated and sometimes violent protests in Ferguson and across the country.   A few days later, Officer Wilson resigned from the Ferguson Police Department.  Despite the lack of criminal charges, the Michael Brown case launched a series of reforms. A federal investigation revealed a pattern of abuse by Ferguson's mostly white police force against the city's majority black residents.  The Justice Department found that ""many officers"" apparently viewed some of the city's black residents ""less as constituents to be protected than as potential offenders and sources of revenue."" Black residents were ticketed and cited for minor violations at a higher rate than white residents, the Justice Department said. The investigation also found a spate of racist emails sent by some police and court officials.   Ferguson police report: The most shocking parts After the scathing Justice Department report, Ferguson police Chief Thomas Jackson resigned.  And the Justice Department sued Ferguson to force police reform in the city. Freddie Gray, 25  Date of death: April 19, 2015, seven days after he was injured Where: Baltimore What happened: An officer on bike patrol made eye contact with Gray, and Gray fled. Police later found a knife in Gray's pocket and arrested him on a weapons charge.   Officers handcuffed Gray and put him in a police van. At some point, Gray suffered a fatal spinal cord injury. He died seven days later.  Gray's death prompted riots, looting and arson in Baltimore.  The outcomes: Six Baltimore police officers, including three black and three white officers, were charged in connection with Gray's death.  Three officers were acquitted: Edward Nero, a bike officer involved in the initial police encounter with Gray; Caesar Goodson, who drove the van; and Lt. Brian Rice, the highest-ranking officer charged in connection with Gray's death. Prosecutors dropped charges against the three remaining officers: Garrett Miller; Alicia White and William Porter. Aside from the criminal trials, Baltimore officials approved a $6.4 million deal to settle all civil claims tied to Gray's death.  The settlement did not ""represent any judgment"" on whether the officers were guilty or innocent, Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said.  ""This settlement represents an opportunity to bring closure to the Gray family, the community and the city."""," 'Black Lives Matter' cases: When controversial killings lead to change, we ask why
 The protests have been building in the United States since the death of George Floyd. The protests have been led by the phrase ""Black Lives Matter"" and have been seen as an expression of the struggles of Black people in the US. But some say it is an outdated term that misses the larger issue of police brutality against people of color. Some say it is a form of white supremacy that is exploiting the protests and playing on racial tensions to gain power. Here are some of the protests and what they mean. Ferguson, Missouri Protesters have been gathering in Ferguson since the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown. The protests have been seen as an expression of the struggles of Black people in the US. But some say it is an outdated term that misses the larger issue of police brutality against people of color. The ""Black Lives Matter"" movement started in the wake of the Michael Brown case in Ferguson, Missouri. It is now seen as a white nationalist movement that plays on racial tensions. Black Lives Matter is a ""political statement"" and not a statement of ""objective reality,"" says Ali Velshi, a professor of English at the University of California-Davis. ""It is a political statement that is not based on objective reality, so it is not a statement about what is happening in real life,"" he says. ""It is not a statement of what is happening in the world."" The term ""Black Lives Matter"" is often used in a political context, though it does not necessarily mean the same thing as it does when used in a literal sense. ""It's a statement of a set of principles that comes together in a very clear and effective way to say that black lives do matter,"" says Maya Torri, a writer and activist. ""It's a statement of a set of demands that are being put forward in an organized way and that is powerful."" The ""Black Lives Matter"" protests have been a part of a broader movement that is also calling for social justice. The term has been used to describe a broad range of social justice issues, including police brutality, structural racism, environmental racism and anti-blackness. ""Black Lives Matter is not a political statement,"" says Torri. ""It's a statement of a set of demands."" Protesters in Portland, Oregon, have been demanding police reform and the end of police brutality for months. They have been protesting against the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor for months. On Sunday, they held a candlelight vigil in front of the US Capitol building in front of the White House. The protest was part of a wider campaign to call for a more just society. ""We are here to say that black lives do matter,"" Torri says. ""We are here to say that black lives matter. We are here to say that black lives matter. And we are here to say that black lives matter."" Protesters in New York City have been staging sit-ins and rallies for months. They have demanded that the city's police department and other city departments end racial profiling and police brutality. They have also called for the arrest of NYPD officers involved in the deaths of Eric Garner and NYPD Officer Daniel Pantaleo. On Sunday, the city's mayor, Bill de Blasio, called for calm. ""As we continue to see images of violence between police and citizens, it is clear that New York City's police officers are not the only face of the city's black community,"" he said. ""The city's black and brown community needs a mayor who is willing to listen and who is willing to listen to their pain and anger."" Protests in Los Angeles and Washington, DC Demonstrations in both cities have been taking place since the death of George Floyd. The protests have been seen as an expression of the struggles of Black people in the US. But some say it is an outdated term that misses the larger issue of police brutality against people of color. ""It's not a political statement, it's a statement of a set of principles that are going to be put forth in a clear and effective way,"" says Torri. ""It's not a statement of what's happening in real life. It's a statement of what's in the future and what's coming to the future."" One protest in Los Angeles took place Sunday night. Organizers said the purpose of the event was to ""reclaim our city and reclaim our streets."" The event was organized by the Los Angeles Black Lives Matter chapter. ""The mission of the Los Angeles Black Lives Matter chapter is to educate, organize and empower the black community in support of the issues that matter most: racial justice, economic equality, social justice, the right to health care, the end of police brutality, and a climate where all people of color feel safe and valued,"" the group said on its website. ""We are proud to be a part of the Los Angeles Black Lives Matter chapter."" Protests in Washington, DC have been taking place since the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black",1023

The dress was designed by Florida-based designer Terrence Torrence. The dress features pictures of 15 African-Americans who  were killed in police-involved shootings, he said. ""With all the killings that was going on, it just hit me one day: you should put that into a dress,"" Torrence told CNN.  ""I wanted to paint a picture and put a story out there through my fashion, and I wanted to show we could spread out message with not just posters and fliers but also with garments,"" he added. Milan Bolden-Morris asked Torrence to design her prom dress after he designed her cousin's wedding dress.  ""Yes I'm black. Yes I'm 17.

83,https://www.cnn.com/2017/04/09/us/3-ways-wwi-shapes-america/index.html, From Syria to Black Lives Matter: 3 ways WWI still shapes America ," But on May 4, 1918, Johnson grabbed a two-inch bolo knife and a splintered rifle and did something so remarkable that he earned another name: ""Black Death."" Johnson was a US sergeant standing sentry one night in a French forest when a German raiding party attacked. The swarming Germans shot Johnson in his lip, head and side. Yet Johnson kept shooting back. When his rifle jammed, he grabbed it by the barrel and clubbed more Germans. Then he used the bolo knife to stab and disembowel another enemy soldier. He kept throwing grenades until he fainted from blood loss. When his comrades found Johnson the next morning, they discovered he had killed four Germans and wounded about 20 more. They could still see the bloody trails of wounded Germans who had crawled into the woods to escape Johnson's fury. Johnson had been wounded 21 times but somehow survived the hourlong battle. ""There wasn't anything so fine about it,"" Johnson would say later when praised for his gallantry. ""Just fought for my life. A rabbit would have done that."" Johnson's story is featured in PBS' ""The Great War,"" a stirring account of America's entry into World War I. The three-part ""American Experience"" film, which begins airing Monday, devotes six hours over three nights to explaining why the nation decided to enter ""the war that would end all wars"" 100 years ago this month.  Johnson's story captures what's distinctive about the film. He was a black soldier who faced something even more lethal than German bayonets when he returned home. He discovered an America that was also at war with itself. Some of the most ferocious battles during World War I took place not in Europe but on the streets of America -- and some are still being fought today. What should the President do when a foreign dictator is accused of murdering women and children? Does the US welcome too many immigrants? Are corporations too powerful? Are women treated like second-class citizens? Those might seem like questions ripped from today's headlines, yet they literally provoked riots and lynch mobs during World War I, the film shows. Few people today, however, know how relevant the war remains because it seems so distant, trapped forever in wobbly black-and-white silent film, historians say.  ""The First World War is the most important event that most people don't know about,"" says Dan Carlin, a historian whose ""Hardcore History"" podcast examines World War I. ""It's a Pandora's box. We're still ironing out what it unleashed."" Here are three battles from ""The Great War"" the United States is still waging: No. 1: Fighting the enemy among us  They speak in funny accents and don't care about fitting in. So many are pouring across the border that they're threatening the American way of life. They're not real Americans.  That's what many Americans thought of German-Americans during World War I. If you think political battles over immigration are tough today, they were vicious when America entered World War I, ""The Great War"" shows. A wave of hysteria aimed at German-Americans swept the nation as it struggled to assimilate what was then its largest ethnic group.  America didn't just declare war on Germany -- it waged war on German-American culture. Newspapers warned of ""German troublemakers"" and ""German traps."" People refused to drink German beer, and children were instructed to rip German songs out of music books. In one Ohio town, officials slaughtered all dogs belonging to German breeds.   A German-American coal miner accused of being a spy was even attacked by a mob, stripped of his clothes and hanged from a tree, the film reveals. The Washington Post applauded the mob's actions. ""Big parts of the American public lost their minds about the nature of the society they live in and the threats they faced from their neighbors who happen to have German names,"" Pulitzer Prize-winning historian David Kennedy says in the film. It was a time of demographic panic. When World War I erupted in Europe in 1914, the United States had a population of about 100 million immigrants. Millions of other Americans had parents who were born abroad. Those citizens who didn't fit the definition of a ""real American"" faced persecution and torture. One of the most wrenching segments in the film looks at the story of three US citizens who became conscientious objectors to the war. They were David, Michael and Joseph Hofer, otherwise known as the ""Hofer brothers."" The three South Dakota men were members of the Hutterites, a group of Christian pacifists. Hutterite men already drew suspicion because they wore long beards and hair and spoke German.  When the Hofer brothers were drafted, they refused to fight or wear a uniform. They were imprisoned in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and brutally treated. They were denied food and water, forced to stand in freezing temperatures with scant clothing, and chained in a cell for up to nine hours a day. Two of them died. But none recanted their religious beliefs. ""It's really torture,"" Michael Kazin, author of ""War Against War: The American Fight for Peace, 1914-1918,"" tells the film. ""It has to be called that."" As a final indignity, the body of one of the two brothers who died was dressed in the military uniform he refused to wear when he was alive. Brutality wasn't confined to the trenches of Europe. There was plenty of it in the streets of America. No. 2. Crushing popular dissent with patriotism When President Donald Trump dispatched Tomahawk missiles to an air base in Syria last week after the country's ruler was accused of launching lethal chemical attacks, he was operating from a script first penned by President Woodrow Wilson during World War I. It was Wilson who said America should enter the war to make the world ""safe for democracy."" The notion that America had a moral responsibility to respond militarily to atrocities abroad began during World War I, ""The Great War"" shows. ""The modern version of the United States is born in this war,"" says Carlin, the ""Hardcore"" podcast historian. ""The Great War"" also shows how the idealism of war can be used to crush populist movements. World War I occurred during a surge of progressive activism in the United States. The labor movement was powerful, and socialists, communists and anarchists were common figures in public life. Women were leading the anti-war effort as well as crusading for the right to vote. Yet much of this progressive momentum was halted by a crushing of popular dissent by the federal government, the film shows.  During the war, Wilson signed the Espionage Act and Sedition Act, which made it illegal to say almost anything against the United States or its war effort. Criticism of the US became dangerous. American internment camps didn't begin with the Japanese in World War II. The US government created them for political prisoners during World War I, the film shows. That suppression even targeted one of the most famous progressive leaders of the time, Eugune Debs. Debs was the Bernie Sanders of his day. A socialist labor organizer and presidential candidate, he was arrested in 1918 for giving an anti-war speech and sentenced to 10 years in prison under the Espionage Act.  Wilson ultimately paid a price for his clampdown on radical and liberal groups. After the war ended, he tried to create a League of Nations that would mediate international disputes and prevent another world war from erupting. But he couldn't get the US Senate to agree to join the League, in part because his crackdown on anti-war activity had alienated or weakened any potential progressive allies. Wilson would die of a stroke just six years later. He is depicted in the film as a tragic figure -- idealistic but deeply racist, a gifted politician who could have seen his League of Nations succeed if he had just bent a little to his political opposition. ""There comes a time when bitterness overtakes shrewdness, and to the end of his life he was a very bitter man,"" Yale historian Jay Winter says of Wilson in the film. ""I don't know anyone who can tell me why it was that Wilson didn't compromise. And as a result, he loses it all. He loses everything."" No. 3. Debating whether all lives matter She was born to a prosperous Quaker family in New Jersey but spent her life reviled by much of the American public. She was attacked by angry mobs and force-fed in prison after going on a hunger strike. Once, prison officials even tried to declare her insane. Nevertheless, Alice Paul persisted. One of the revelations of ""The Great War"" is the prominence of American women in the debate about World War I. It was a time of surging women's activism that would culminate in 1920 with the ratification of the 19th Amendment, giving women the right to vote.  Paul is one of the most fascinating characters in ""The Great War."" She would have fit right in with the massive Women's March on Washington the day after Trump was inaugurated. She placed relentless pressure on Wilson by asking how America could fight for democracy abroad while denying women the right to vote at home. Black American soldiers fought some of the same battles to proclaim their humanity, the film points out.  When many entered the war, they were initially kept from the fighting by being assigned to clean latrines pits and unload supplies. Some were paired with French fighting units, who treated them with more respect than their white counterparts. Some of the most moving images from the film show black soldiers smiling and bantering easily with French troops. That experience transformed many black soldiers. Some historians even trace the beginnings of the modern-day civil rights movement to those black soldiers who returned from World War I determined to assert their rights. In the film, Adriane Lentz-Smith, a Duke University associate professor of history, describes the metamorphosis in black soldiers who served in France: ""Folks didn't think about the etiquette of white supremacy any more than a fish thinks about the wetness of water. But when you step out of a system that people have told you is the only way, and then you look around and there are these people in the world working under a different set of rules, it changes people's imagination."" White America, though, wasn't ready for this New Negro. When these black soldiers returned home, many were greeted by the ""Red Summer,"" often described as a wave of deadly race riots that swept through at least 25 American cities in 1919.  Calling them race riots, though, doesn't fully capture what happened, says Lentz-Smith, author of ""Freedom Struggles: African Americans and World War I."" ""You say riots and people think breaking shop windows and stealing stuff,"" she says. ""They don't have a sense of what white mob violence really looks like. This is going into a black community on a rampage, trying to destroy black wealth, trying to hurt or kill black people. Folks say they're more akin to pogroms in the Jewish communities than any kind of riots we're seeing now."" This is the world Sgt. Johnson returned to after his heroic exploits in France. The French army awarded him its highest medal for valor. But the US Army didn't mention his 21 wounds in his discharge papers or give him disability pay. He returned to his job as a railway porter in Albany, New York, but his injuries made it impossible to continue. Johnson's health faded as he descended into alcoholism and poverty. His wife and children left him, and he died in 1929 at age 32. His descendants believed he was buried in a pauper's grave.  But Johnson's story still had a surprise or two left. A son, Herman, would join the famed Tuskegee Airmen during World War II and eventually lead a campaign to commemorate his father. Politicians got involved. A monument was built in Albany to honor Johnson. And the US Army awarded him a posthumous Medal of Honor. But the Army's highest decoration for valor came with a strange twist. During its research, the Army discovered that Herman Johnson wasn't actually related to the man he thought was his father. The Army attributed Johnson's mistake to ""historical inaccuracy, not fraudulent representation.""  Then something else happened. It turned out Johnson was never buried in a pauper's grave. Someone remembered the soldier known as ""Black Death."" He had been buried with full honors at Arlington National Cemetery, the final resting place for famous American soldiers such as Gen. George C. Marshall, President John F. Kennedy and World War II hero Audie Murphy.  Henry Johnson started as a railroad porter, then became the ""Black Death."" Ultimately the Great War left him with one last title: American hero."," From Syria to Black Lives Matter: 3 ways WWI still shapes America   The list goes on.

84,https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/05/us/black-lives-matter-chicago-facebook-live-beating/index.html, Police: No link between Chicago torture video and Black Lives Matter," But, almost immediately after the video went viral, so did the claims that the Black Lives Matter Movement was to blame.  Chicago police say they see no connection between the suspects and the Black Lives Matter activist group, contrary to some reports on social media. Yet in less than 24 hours, the hashtag #BLMKidnapping was mentioned more than 480,000 times on Twitter and became one of the top five Twitter trends across the country Thursday.  Paul Joseph Watson, editor at large of the website ""Infowars,"" was among the first to tie the attack to Black Lives Matter, a social justice movement that protests violence and racism against African-Americans. ""Infowars"" is known for promoting conspiracy theories, saying the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre was a government hoax and claiming the 9/11 attacks were orchestrated by the US government.  The attackers in the video are black, and the victim is white. In the video, at least one attacker shouts, ""*F*ck Donald Trump! F*ck white people!"" On Thursday, authorities charged four suspects with hate crime, aggravated kidnapping and other charges.  So who's to blame?  Former Chicago police officer Dimitri Roberts said he believes ""this is a hate crime,"" but rejected the notion that Black Lives Matter is responsible.  ""This is hate. And hate doesn't have a color. So for folks to talk about this is somehow connected to Black Lives Matter is absolutely the wrong way to look at this,"" he said.  ""Let's address why this happened. This happened because there was some ignorance, and there are some folks that want to sensationalize their message and become Facebook stars, all right? So let's not start promoting hashtags or be on one side of this issue when we have a real opportunity to unify behind this.""  But many still rallied behind the #BLMKidnapping hashtag, including one person who said -- with no evidence -- that Black Lives Matter is more dangerous than the Ku Klux Klan.  ""The effect of BLM activism is more REAL, pervasive & dangerous than KKK,"" said a Twitter user called Blondes4Trump. ""Why isn't the media warning people?""  Neither the Black Lives Matter national organization nor its Chicago chapter responded to CNN's request for comment.  But DeRay Mckesson, a longtime Black Lives Matter supporter, said on Twitter that those linking the attack to the movement don't have their facts straight.   ""It goes without saying that the actions being branded by the far-right as the ""BLM Kidnapping"" have nothing to do w/ the movement,"" he said. "," Police: No link between Chicago torture video and Black Lives Matter protests

Chicago Police Chief Garry McCarthy said Saturday that he didn't want to see his officers' ""hurt"" and ""maimed"" by the video of the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Laquan McDonald. The officer who shot him, Jason Van Dyke, was found not guilty of first-degree murder charges on Monday, but he did not face any criminal charges in his death. The officer fired 17 shots at the teenager, killing him. ""It's not fair. It's not right,"" McCarthy said. ""It's not fair. I don't want them to be hurt or maimed by the video. I don't want them to go through this. I don't want them to be in the hospital and they don't want to go through this."" Van Dyke's attorney, Ben Crump, told CNN's Don Lemon that his client was trying to use his authority to protect himself and his family. ""This was a vile, vicious act,"" he said. ""It was a calculated, premeditated murder."" The officers' bodies were found Monday in a wooded area near where they were shot. They had been shot with rubber bullets and batons, but there was no evidence of a struggle, police said. 'No one should have to die' The video shows McDonald walking away from officers as he's shot. It is not clear whether he is reaching for an object. He was pronounced dead at a hospital. The video shows the officers' body camera rolling as they stand near a vehicle. It is not clear whether they are still inside that vehicle.

 A black teen, the first person to die in the city since the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown, was killed by a white police officer who'd been ambushed by a group of angry young men, police said. ""It's been a very, very long time since a black person was killed by a police officer,"" said Salena Zayat, a sociology professor at Emory University in Georgia. ""And it's",413
85,https://www.cnn.com/2016/07/29/us/black-lives-matter-blowing-it/index.html, Is Black Lives Matter blowing it?," What does Black Lives Matter want? Not sure? How about this. Can you cite a moment in which a BLM leader passionately and eloquently denounced the recent shooting deaths of eight police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge? Can you name one or two leaders from the movement? Chances are the answers to those questions fall all over the place. Four years after its founding, BLM is still a movement without a clear meaning for many Americans. Some see it has a hate group; others as cutting-edge activism and yet others as just a step above a mob. ""Most of the folks in the movement are young and we're black so they assume we're uneducated and uninformed and we're just angry and in the streets,"" says Johnetta Elzie, a leader in the BLM movement and Campaign Zero, another organization formed to fight police brutality. Those assumptions may now get worse as BLM leaders confront a make-or-break moment that virtually all protest movements eventually face: What happens when your enemies and unexpected events do a better job of defining your movement than you do? BLM leaders are under a new kind of scrutiny because of a whiplash of unexpected events: cell phone videos of two black men who died from police gunfire followed by the ambush and killings of five police officers in Dallas at a Black Lives Matter protest, and three police officers targeted and killed in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  As a result, activists and scholars say BLM is facing the same challenge that confronted striking steelworkers in the 19th century, gay activists blindsided by the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s, and Occupy Wall Street demonstrators in 2011. These movements initially captured the public's imagination, then their existence was threatened by something over which they had no control.    Some of these movements adjusted; others withered. ""The action is on page one; the retraction is on page 88,"" says Jerald E. Podair, a historian and author of ""Bayard Rustin: American Dreamer.""  ""If you cannot adapt you're simply not going to survive."" Can BLM adapt? The same organizing philosophy that has helped the movement grow may lead to its demise, some activists and historians say. They cite these four reasons: Reason No. 1: The buck stops where?  BLM organizers made a bold decision when they organized as a hashtag on Twitter four years ago.  It was going to be a ""leaderful"" organization; not one led by a single leader or a centralized leadership structure. ""We've always made it clear that we are one of many,"" Elzie says. ""There's not one person who can be a leader of the movement. We're all leaders."" There's a shrewd pragmatism to that decision. Movements built around charismatic leaders evaporate when that leader is assassinated or discredited. The civil rights movement never recovered from the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. Few today can name the organization that Malcolm X headed when he was assassinated by Nation of Islam members (It was called the Organization of Afro-American Unity). The movement's decentralized form of leadership, though, can hurt it when responding to a crisis. Who does the media go to when protesters invoking BLM burn a police car or chant ""Pigs in the blanket?"" Who speaks for what BLM wants when it has 37 chapters nationwide that list varying goals in their mission statements? ""When something tragic happens, we're all blamed because there's no central leadership,"" Elzie says. ""We all take a hit."" The recent police shootings led critics to call BLM a hate group. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups, actually felt the need to release a report last week explaining why BLM is not a hate group. BLM leaders took a step this week in defining their movement when they released a ""Black Lives Matter Policy Agenda."" The agenda is the result of a collaboration among at least 50 groups, BLM leaders say. The list of demands is sprawling, but the proposed policies include six central demands: ""end the war on black people,"" reparations, investing in the education and health of black people, economic justice, community control and political power. Read BLM policy agenda Even if people eventually agree on what BLM wants, people still don't know what it is.  In fact, there are at least two versions of BLM. There's the BLM network founded four years ago by three black female activists angry over the death of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teen killed by a neighborhood watch volunteer while walking home. They created the #blacklivesmatter hashtag. Then there's the BLM movement, a more amorphous collection of racial justice groups like Campaign Zero. Elzie, for example, doesn't call herself a BLM network leader. Her group is Campaign Zero, but she does consider herself a member of the BLM movement. Yet there are advantages to decentralized leadership as well. Consider what BLM has accomplished in four years. It has illuminated complex issues like mass incarceration and racial bias in policing for millions of white Americans. BLM activists helped vote out the state's attorney for Cook County, Illinois, this year after it was revealed she waited over a year to file charges against a Chicago police officer who shot to death a black teen.  Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate, has already adopted some of BLM's rhetoric, by talking about systemic racism and saying at one rally, ""Yes, black lives matter."" And President Obama has publicly supported the group at a recent town hall hosted by ABC.   ""The phrase 'Black Lives Matter' simply refers to the notion that there's a specific vulnerability for African-Americans that needs to be addressed,"" Obama said at the town hall. ""It's not meant to suggest that other lives don't matter; it's to suggest that other folks aren't experiencing this particular vulnerability.""  According to a Pew Research Center poll released last month --  taken before the Dallas shootings -- roughly 4 in 10 Americans support BLM. Still, a large number, 30%, said they have not heard anything or had no opinion about BLM. And about 40% of whites who have heard of BLM say they don't understand its goals. Great leaders eventually emerge in most protest movements, says Timothy Patrick McCarthy, an activist and Harvard history professor who studies protest movements.  ""Martin Luther King wasn't Martin when the movement began,"" says McCarthy, author of ""Protest Nation: Words That Inspired a Century of American Radicalism."" ""We have yet to see perhaps a leader like King or Malcolm X or Ella Baker emerge. Maybe we have and we don't just know it yet.""   Reason No. 2: They're not trying to speak White America's language Here's something else that's striking about BLM: The movement is filled with passionate and eloquent speakers, but can anyone name a great speech or even a memorable soundbite by a BLM leader? One speech and one image come to mind. The electrifying speech by actor and activist Jesse Williams defending BLM at the recent BET awards.  And the viral photo of Ieisha Evans, BLM marcher, facing off against a phalanx of riot police. She is armed with nothing but a look of serene resolve. But there's little sense yet that BLM has consistently come up with the type of reassuring language that has traditionally moved skeptical white Americans. It is a language King spoke to goad them into action, one historian says. King grounded his appeals for justice in the language of the Bible and the nation's founding documents. In his ""I Have a Dream"" speech, King told his audience that his dream was ""deeply rooted in the American dream."" In others he urged Americans to ""be true to what you said on paper,"" referring to the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. ""That's what made Martin Luther King Martin Luther King,"" says Podair, history professor at Lawrence University in Wisconsin. ""If you can do that in an eloquent way you can reach across to some white Americans and they will be moved. Then you're speaking their language."" BLM leaders, however, have made another tactical decision: They're not going to try to adjust their message to reach white America.   ""Black people for too long have been forced to refine our message according to what is comfortable for the mainstream,"" says Brittany Packnett, one of the BLM movement leaders. ""We have made a distinctive choice not to do it.""     That decision, to not couch their message to get white buy-in, can be seen in the BET speech by  Jesse Williams, who said ""the burden of the brutalized is not to comfort the bystander."" ""If you have no interest in equal rights for black people then do not make suggestions to those who do. Sit down,"" Williams said.   Packnett says a movement can't call for black freedom if its leaders don't embody it:   ""Our goal is to be free and authentic, not to pacify others.""   Even if BLM adapted its language, it would still be difficult to reach beyond its core supporters, says McCarthy, the Harvard historian. When King spoke of his dream, most Americans got their news from three television networks and newspapers.  Today, more people live in media cocoons where they listen only to political voices they agree with, he says. ""You're not going to get that 18 to 20 minute powerful speech on the Mall where you have MLK talking his dream,"" he says. ""We have so many more voices communicating in these spaces. Everybody tweets, Snapchats and posts on Facebook. Everybody has a platform."" Reason No. 3: They're not trying to mobilize the black church Black protest movements have traditionally sought support from the black church.  It is the most potent organizing force for political change in the black community. The most famous slave rebellion was led by a black preacher, Nat Turner. The black church powered the civil rights movement led by King. Today, contemporary black churches do everything from voting registration drives to educating people about Obamacare.   The BLM, though, is betting that a black protest movement can succeed without the explicit support of the black church. While BLM leaders work with individual black churches and pastors, they say on their website that ""this current movement has a very different relationship to the church than movements past."" ""Protesters patently reject any conservative theology about keeping the peace, praying copiously, or turning the other cheek,"" an unnamed essayist says on the BLM website. ""Such calls are viewed as a return to passive respectability politics."" The BLM is wary of the black church for several reasons. One is the makeup of its leadership. Some of BLM's best-known leaders are women or gay, groups that have traditionally been marginalized by the black church. And then there is the autocratic leadership style of many black pastors. Elzie says BLM has reached out to well-known black pastors who won't join because they want to be in charge. ""If you want to be involved and be in the streets in the protests, that means knowing that you're in the middle of the crowds and you're not the leader,"" she says. ""It's hard for some to be at the table if they're not the one leading the conversations.""       ""Traditional"" civil rights leaders have also given BLM a mixed reception. The Rev. Andy Young, a close aide to King, recently called BLM protesters ""unlovable little brats"" but later apologized. The Rev. Al Sharpton criticized BLM protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, for not voting to change their city government. But the NAACP has adopted some of BLM's rhetoric and even helped local BLM leaders organize. And Marc Morial, president of the National Urban League, said that BLM was ""adding support and momentum"" to the contemporary civil rights struggle. A black protest movement, though, doesn't need the widespread support of the black church to be successful, one historian says. King proved that.    Large segments of the traditional black church rejected King, says Clarence Lang, author of ""Black America in the Shadow of the Sixties: Notes on the Civil Rights Movement, Neoliberalism, and Politics."" King was part of a ""militant minority"" in the black church because many of its leaders thought he was too radical, Lang says.   At a BLM rally it doesn't matter if you're straight, gay, well-dressed, white, transgender, young -- all are welcome. ""One of the most promising aspects of Black Lives Matter is that it has been able to create a political space that allows African-Americans to participate openly from so many different identities and walks of life, including those outside the boundaries of what might be considered 'respectable,' "" says Lang, a professor of African and African-American studies at the University of Kansas. Reason No. 4: Movements that don't bend are broken ""No battle plan survives contact with the enemy."" That's a military adage that underscores the unpredictability of warfare.  Great battles are often won not by genius strategizing but by chance events: a freak storm destroys a fleet of warships; an absentminded soldier loses crucial battle plans; a general falls ill on the eve of a campaign.   Protest movements often face the same abrupt reversals of fate, says Podair, the historian. He cites an infamous defeat from the union movement, the Homestead steelworkers strike. The steelworkers union initially looked like it had won a bloody battle against a ruthless figure of the Robber Baron era, steel titan Andrew Carnegie. On July 6, 1892, thousands of unionized steelworkers successfully beat back 300 armed detectives who had been dispatched to the Homestead steel mill by Carnegie to crush the strike.  They were protesting working 12-hour days, and six to seven day work weeks, and their plight earned sympathetic newspaper coverage across the nation. That sympathy evaporated about three weeks later because of the actions of one gunman. An anarchist tried to assassinate Henry Clay Frick, Carnegie's plant manager at Homestead and his designated union buster. Frick's reaction -- he and others subdued his would-be assassin after being shot twice and stabbed four times -- made him a hero to the American public. The public then connected a mounting anxiety over anarchists to the striking steelworkers.   ""The union disavowed the anarchist but it was too late,"" says Podair. ""The strike fails and the steelworkers don't get a union going for another 30 years."" History turns on a hinge; movements that don't learn to adjust often fizzle, Podair says. He cites the example of Occupy Wall Street. It attracted support but didn't have a Plan B after occupying Zuccotti Park near Wall Street. ""They did not adapt,"" Podair says. ""They were so protest- and spectacle-oriented that they never made the transition into electoral politics, which is where the power is in a democracy."" McCarthy, the Harvard historian, doesn't think Occupy Wall Street should be called a failure. Nor should it be judged by its power to get candidates elected.      ""We wouldn't have had a Bernie Sanders campaign if it wasn't for the Occupy movement,"" he says. ""We wouldn't have the language of the 1% or Democratic presidential candidates calling for more regulations of the banks."" McCarthy says a better illustration of a movement's need to adapt is the gay rights movement. It was devastated by the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s. That's when the gay community realized that it had to develop more confrontational and theatrical forms of protest because the nation's political and medical community were ignoring the crisis, he says. ACT UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power), a new coalition of direct action groups, used high-profile demonstrations and acts of civil disobedience to further their agenda.    ""The movement could have been derailed and died but they rose up, spoke up and acted up,"" McCarthy says. ""And that movement is still with us today.""  Will BLM still exist in the years ahead? At least publicly, BLM leaders don't speak of changing their approach.  Packnett says BLM has repeatedly said that it's not violent or anti-police. ""We've all said that,"" she says after a big sigh. ""People hear what they want to hear. It doesn't fit with the narrative that critics want to have.""  The future may produce more unexpected narratives for the movement. What if another black shooter attacks police and invokes BLM? What if new cell phone footage shows police officers,  not unarmed black people, being gunned down? What if the names of Trayvon Martin, Sandra Bland and slogans like ""I Can't Breathe"" fade from public memory? Will a ""leaderful"" movement that refuses to speak white America's language adapt? Or will it squander the momentum built the last four years? If the latter is the case, BLM leaders may confront this question in the future: ""Hey, whatever happened to Black Lives Matter?"""," Is Black Lives Matter blowing it? It was a story you could have easily forgotten. ""I think that's a really powerful story,"" she said. ""It really is a testament to the power of the Black Lives Matter movement."" Even though the video didn't go viral until this week, it sparked a firestorm of reaction. Some said the video was proof that police violence against black people is not just a problem in America. ""This is a national issue,"" said Jason Ford, a political commentator who said the video was ""very, very troubling."" ""We need to look at what's happening in these communities in a broader perspective. It's not just an American problem, it's a global problem."" CNN political commentator Van Jones said he thinks the video is a ""very powerful demonstration"" that the video is ""not just an American problem."" ""It's a global problem, because it's not just a problem in America, it's a problem in every country in the world where you have a population that is not represented in some way,"" he said.

86,https://www.cnn.com/2016/07/13/us/black-lives-matter-updates/index.html, 'Black Lives Matter' cases: What happened after the protests? ," But each case that spurs ""black lives matter"" marches has different circumstances -- and different outcomes. Here are how some high-profile cases have turned out:  Trayvon Martin, 17 Date of death: February 26, 2012 Where: Sanford, Florida What happened: Martin was walking from a convenience store back to the home of his father's fiancee. Neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman spots him from his car and calls 911, reporting ""a real suspicious guy.""  ""This guy looks like he's up to no good, or he's on drugs or something,"" Zimmerman told a dispatcher. ""It's raining, and he's just walking around."" A scuffle broke out, but there were no direct witnesses. Zimmerman claimed Martin attacked him, hitting him in the nose and knocking him onto the pavement. Zimmerman said he then took out his gun and shot Martin in self defense.   But critics said Zimmerman was unjustified in confronting the unarmed teen, especially since Zimmerman didn't heed a police dispatcher's advice to stop following him. The outcomes: Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder but was found not guilty. The acquittal ignited protests across the country, and the ""Black Lives Matter"" movement gained national prominence.  The case also led to the firing of Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee, who was criticized for not arresting Zimmerman after Martin was killed.  Why this verdict? Five things that led to Zimmerman's acquittal Eric Garner, 43 Date of death: July 17, 2014  Where: New York City  What happened: Police tried to arrest Garner in front of a store for allegedly selling cigarettes illegally. Garner raised both hands and told officers not to touch him. Seconds later, Officer Daniel Pantaleo grabbed the 350-pound man in a chokehold and pulled him to the sidewalk, rolling him onto his stomach. The New York Police Department prohibits the use of chokeholds.  Garner, who had asthma, repeatedly said, ""I can't breathe! I can't breathe!"" while several officers restrained him on the ground. Police said he suffered a heart attack and died en route to a hospital. The outcomes: A grand jury declined to indict Pantaleo, sparking protests and ""die-ins.""  Garner's death also spurred a new protest slogan: ""I can't breathe,"" referring to some of his final words before he died. Several professional athletes wore shirts saying ""I can't breathe"" in silent protest.  Pantaleo offered his condolences to Garner's family and said he never intended to hurt Garner. The police union defended Pantaleo, saying he just wanted to take Garner into custody after the suspect resisted.  New York City eventually settled with Garner's family for $5.9 million. City Comptroller Scott Stringer said the settlement ""acknowledges the tragic nature of Mr. Garner's death,"" but ""the city has not admitted liability."" Michael Brown, 18 Date of death: August 9, 2014 Where: Ferguson, Missouri  What happened: Brown was walking with a friend in the middle of a street when Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson approached them and told them to walk on the sidewalk.  After that, the narratives varied enormously. Authorities said Brown had attacked the officer in his car and tried to take his gun. Others said the teenager was surrendering, his hands in the air to show he was unarmed, when the officer opened fire. Documents showed that Wilson fired his gun 12 times. What happened when Michael Brown met Officer Darren Wilson   The outcomes: A grand jury decided not to indict Wilson -- leading to heated and sometimes violent protests in Ferguson and across the country.   A few days later, Officer Wilson resigned from the Ferguson Police Department.  Despite the lack of criminal charges, the Michael Brown case launched a series of reforms. A federal investigation revealed a pattern of abuse by Ferguson's mostly white police force against the city's majority black residents.  The Justice Department found that ""many officers"" apparently viewed some of the city's black residents ""less as constituents to be protected than as potential offenders and sources of revenue."" Black residents were ticketed and cited for minor violations at a higher rate than white residents, the Justice Department said. The investigation also found a spate of racist emails sent by some police and court officials.   Ferguson police report: The most shocking parts After the scathing Justice Department report, Ferguson police Chief Thomas Jackson resigned.   And in February, the Justice Department sued Ferguson to force police reform in the city. Walter Scott, 50 Date of death: April 4, 2015 Where: North Charleston, South Carolina  What happened: Officer Michael Slager pulled Scott over for a broken taillight. Scott bolted out of his car, though it's not clear why. His family attorney speculated that Scott's flight stemmed from his unpaid child support ""and a fear of maybe going back (to jail).""  As Scott ran away from the officer, a witness captured video of Slager shooting Scott several times in the back.  Who was Walter Scott? The outcomes: The North Charleston Police Department fired Slager, and a grand jury indicted him on a state murder charge.  A federal grand jury also indicted Slager for misleading investigators and violating Scott's civil rights.  After Scott's death, the South Carolina Legislature passed a bill mandating the use of police body cameras.  And the North Charleston City Council agreed to a $6.5 million settlement with Scott's family. Freddie Gray, 25  Date of death: April 19, 2015, seven days after he was fatally injured Where: Baltimore What happened: An officer on bike patrol made eye contact with Gray, and Gray fled. Police later found a knife in Gray's pocket and arrested him on a weapons charge.   Officers put Gray in a police van. At some point, Gray somehow suffered a fatal spinal cord injury. He died seven days later.  Gray's death prompted riots, looting and arson in Baltimore.  The outcomes: Six Baltimore police officers, including three black and three white officers, were charged in connection with Gray's death.  Three officers were acquitted: Edward Nero, a bike officer involved in the initial police encounter with Gray; Caesar Goodson, who drove the van; and Lt. Brian Rice, the highest-ranking officer charged in connection with Gray's death. On July 27, 2016, prosecutors dropped charges against the three remaining officers: Garrett Miller; Alicia White and William Porter. Aside from the criminal trials, Baltimore officials approved a $6.4 million deal to settle all civil claims tied to Gray's death.  The settlement did not ""represent any judgment"" on the guilt or innocence of the six police officers charged, Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said.  ""This settlement represents an opportunity to bring closure to the Gray family, the community and the city."""," 'Black Lives Matter' cases: What happened after the protests?  The demonstrations, which were largely peaceful, grew into a fierce debate between supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement and those who said the movement is racist and that police are using the protests as a pretext to justify their own actions. As the debate heated up, the state of Missouri saw some protests turn violent, with protesters smashing windows, looting and setting cars ablaze. While some protesters were peaceful, others clashed with police in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, which saw the deaths of unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown and unarmed 18-year-old Eric Garner. The death of the unarmed 18-year-old sparked riots in Ferguson. At least six people were arrested. In St. Louis, police said the crowds turned violent when a group of protesters threw rocks and bottles at officers. At least six people were injured, including one who suffered a broken arm.
 ""The protests were supposed to be peaceful, but they turned violent,"" she said. ""And that's not what we want our community to do."" A grand jury decided not to indict Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson in the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, sparking protests and calls for his resignation. Protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, have been demanding justice for the young black man since he was shot by an officer there in August. ""It's been a year since Michael Brown was killed, and the city has not made it simple,"" said Kathleen Zellner, a lawyer with the Legal Aid Society. ""It's been a year of protests and demonstrations and protests of what happened and demonstrations of what should have happened.""  ""There are still people in Ferguson who have not learned the lessons of last year,"" she said. ""And they are still waiting for the justice they deserve.""  Ferguson's current police chief, Jim McNally, said he wants to see the community's involvement in the decision. ""We want to be transparent with the community,"" he said. ""And we want to do that in a way that protects the community's trust and confidence in the police department.""
 ""We've got to be honest with you,"" he said. ""We don't want to be remembered as the city that they remember. We don't want to be remembered as the people that they were in 2012. We don't want to be remembered as the people that they saw in 2013. We don't want to be remembered as the people that they saw in 2014."" But he did not want to use the phrase ""Black Lives Matter"" or ""I can't breathe,"" which was used by protesters and police during the protests.  He also didn't want to use the term ""Black Lives Matter"" or ""All lives matter.""  ""I don't want to use the phrase 'All lives matter.' I'm not trying to say that we all have to take sides in this debate, but we do have to have our own perspective,"" he said. ""We don't have to agree with everything that's going on. We don't have to agree with everything that's happening.""  And he said it was ""very important for us to have our own perspective.""   ""I want to make it clear that we do not agree with everything that's happening in the world,"" he said. ""We do not have to agree with everything that's happening in this world.""  Ferguson Mayor James Knowles III said the city's troubles in the wake of the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown ""will not be solved by one side or the other."" ""We have to be clear, we do not want a repeat of the events of 2012, which resulted in the death of young Michael Brown and the destruction of a great city,"" Knowles said. ""We have to move forward, we have to move forward, we have to move forward."" ""The people of Ferguson have asked for peace and the city has agreed to move forward,"" he said. ""But peace will only come when we move forward in our own direction. That's not what we want to see.""  ""We want to move forward, we want to move forward in our community, we want to move forward in our country, we want to move forward in our community,"" Knowles said. ""We're not moving backward, we're moving forward.""  ""We want to move forward, we want to move forward in the right direction. We're not moving forward, we're moving forward. We're not moving forward, we're moving forward.""  ""We're not moving forward, we're moving forward,"" he said.  ""We are moving forward, we are moving forward.""  ""We're moving forward, we are moving forward,"" he said. ""We're moving forward, we're moving forward.""  ""We're moving forward, we're moving forward,"" he said.

Members of the reigning WNBA champions wore the black-and-white shirts during warm-ups before a game Saturday against the Dallas Wings. ""Change starts with us. Justice & accountability,"" the front of the shirts said. On the back, the T-shirts showed the names of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, two African-American men killed by police last week. It also displayed the Dallas Police Department emblem and the phrase, ""Black Lives Matter."" ""We as a nation can decide to stand up for what is right, no matter your race, background or social status,"" forward Maya Moore told reporters. ""It is time that we take a deep look at our ability to be compassionate and empathetic to those suffering from the problems that are deep within our society. Again, this is a human issue, and we need to speak out for change together."" A tragic first week of July Union: Other officers may follow suit The message reportedly didn't sit well with Minneapolis officers who were working off-duty, providing security at the event. Four of them walked off the job that night and removed themselves from a list of officers working future games, according to the Star Tribune, which cited a local police union leader. Lt. Bob Kroll, president of the Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis, did not immediately respond to a request from CNN for comment. In an interview with the Star Tribune, he praised the officers' move, adding that others may follow suit. Kroll criticized the Lynx players, the Star Tribune said. ""Rushing to judgment before the facts are in is unwarranted and reckless,"" he said, according to the newspaper. In a statement Tuesday, Minneapolis police Chief Janeé Harteau said she understands how the off-duty officers felt but does not condone their actions. ""Although these officers were working on behalf of the Lynx, when wearing a Minneapolis Police uniform I expect all officers to adhere to our core values and to honor their oath of office,"" she said. ""Walking off the job and defaulting on their contractual obligation to provide a service to the Lynx does not conform to the expectations held by the public for the uniform these officers wear."" But police, Harteau said, deserve and need public support. ""While I do not condone the actions of the officers, I realize how every member of law enforcement throughout this country, including myself, is feeling right now,"" she said. ""Everyone is hurting and we all need to find a way to come together. I am proud of our profession and the service our officers provide on a daily basis."" 'Scared for my brothers and sisters' The players told reporters that their shirts aimed to honor those who lost their lives in the past week, and to call for an end to racial profiling and senseless violence, CNN affiliate WCCO-TV in Minneapolis reported. Moore praised the Dallas police for its training and other efforts to lower officer-involved shootings, according to WCCO. ""Racism and unjust phobic fear of black males and disregard of black females is very real,"" Lynx player Rebekkah Brunson said. ""When we look at the facts, it's hard to deny that there's a real problem in our society. I'm scared for my brothers and sisters, my nieces and nephews, my future son or daughter."" In a statement Tuesday, the team said it had been made aware of the off-duty officers' concerns. ""While our players' message mourned the loss of life due to last week's shootings, we respect the right of those individual officers to express their own beliefs in their own way,"" the Lynx said. ""At no time was the safety of our game in question as Target Center staffs extra personnel for each and every game. The Lynx and the entire WNBA have been saddened by the recent shootings in Dallas, Baton Rouge, and St. Paul. We continue to urge a constructive discussion about the issues raised by these tragedies."" Athletes and activism It isn't the first time sports stars have added their voices to a chorus of protesters speaking out over police violence. In 2014, after a New York grand jury decided not to indict an officer in the death of Eric Garner, athletes across the United States wore T-shirts emblazoned with Garner's last words, ""I can't breathe."" Earlier that year, five players from the St. Louis Rams walked onto the football field with their palms in the air, demonstrating the ""hands up, don't shoot"" gesture that protesters used in demonstrations over the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri."," Off-duty cops walk out over WNBA players' Black Lives Matter shirts.

Though he is not directly involved with the movement, he calls himself ""a supporter from afar."" He said the recent protests over the deaths of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling are ""a positive step."" Blake is less enthusiastic about former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who called the movement ""inherently racist."" ""It's just shocking that someone that's ever held public office or that's gotten anywhere he has gotten in his life can have that kind of view on it,"" he says. Blake's firsthand understanding of the meaning behind the movement does not just come from last year's case. A board investigating that incident determined that police used excessive force. As a young athlete, he says he was pulled over far more than his white friends. His parents received death threats as he became successful on the tennis tour.  Moving forward, Blake calls for better training and accountability for police officers. ""There shouldn't be a way of shielding them because they're police officers,"" he said. ""They're still human beings, and if they commit a crime, they still need to be held accountable."" "," James Blake: Black Lives Matter is 'long overdue' In a statement, the Rev. Al Sharpton said he was pleased to see the announcement. ""It is long overdue,"" he said. ""The Black Lives Matter movement has always been about the right to live, work and love freely, and this decision sends a powerful message that this is a time for change in America."" ""It is critical that we understand this is not a victory, but a moment of reckoning for those who have been silent,"" he said. ""The Black Lives Matter movement has been the vehicle for change and change in our country, and we are proud to be a part of it."" The Rev. Al Sharpton said the group has been ""stumbling"" on the issue of police reform. ""We're going to have to get back to work,"" he said. ""We're going to have to do it the right way. We're going to have to do it the right way because the American people are tired of it.",192

At least two officers were injured by protesters -- one hit with a glass bottle and the other by fireworks, according to St. Paul police.  Police used crowd control measures including smoke, police spokesman Steve Linders said.  Parts of the freeway are closed after as many as 200 people forced their way past Minnesota state patrol troopers who were trying to block them from getting on the road.  D.C: Peaceful demonstrations  In Washington, a group marched peacefully through downtown Saturday night, chanting, ""We young. We strong. We marching all night on."" They temporarily shut down Rock Creek Parkway.  About 400 people covered a city block as marchers moved across a large area of northwest Washington and headed toward the Georgetown neighborhood late in the night. It was the third night of marches in Washington.  Marchers included a mixed-race couple carrying a sign that said, ""Injustice anywhere threatens justice everywhere,"" and a little girl with her parents, wearing a white tank-top with the words ""My life matters"" written on it in marker. Eugene Puryear, the march organizer, said the shooting of five police officers in Dallas on Thursday was tragic but inevitable because of police violence against African-Americans. ""We're at a tipping point,"" he said. Confrontations In Atlanta, a group of protesters confronted police over Interstates 75 and 85, then moved into the Midtown business district. Friday night, a large group that included rapper T.I. blocked a downtown Atlanta Interstate ramp. Marchers also took to the streets Saturday night in Miami, with police saying Interstate 395 was shut down for a brief period. A reporter for CNN affiliate WPLG tweeted that demonstrators had blocked a major thoroughfare. In Fort Lauderdale, Florida, a large group of Black Lives Matter supporters walked to the Broward County Courthouse and then the county jail, where prisoners heard their shouts and tapped on windows in response, WPLG reported. Week of unrest The protests erupted initially after videos surfaced showing fatal police encounters with two black men, Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, in Louisiana and Minnesota, respectively.  Their deaths -- along with those of several African-Americans before them -- spurred anger and debate over the use of force by police and questions over racial profiling. The protests came after a sniper killed five police officers during a demonstration in Dallas on Thursday.  Black Lives Matter condemned the Dallas attack, calling it a tragedy not just for those affected but also for the nation. ""Black activists have raised the call for an end to violence, not an escalation of it. (Thursday's) attack was the result of the actions of a lone gunman,"" the group said in a statement on its website. ""To assign the actions of one person to an entire movement is dangerous and irresponsible. We continue our efforts to bring about a better world for all of us."""," Black Lives Matter protesters return to the streets in a renewed effort to force change in the country's largest police department. As of Sunday night, the protest movement had grown to include more than 30 organizations across the country. The goal: to force the formation of a new Black Lives Matter national office.

91,https://www.cnn.com/2015/12/28/us/black-lives-matter-evolution/index.html, The rise of Black Lives Matter: Trying to break the cycle of violence and silence," The Black Lives Matter movement has pushed itself into the national conversation again and again. It seems anyone can join them and anyone can claim to be a part of the movement, simply by creating a Facebook page or using a hashtag.  Still, it is praised as much as it is criticized. While there is no way to know exactly how large the movement has become, the organization has branched out with chapters in 31 cities and held rallies, boycotts and other actions across the United States, according to one of the co-founders. For a group that started with a hashtag in 2012 after the shooting death of Trayvon Martin in Florida, it has grown into a social juggernaut. It has changed the way people talk about police brutality and inequality.  ""Because of social media we reach people in the smallest corners of America. We are plucking at a cord that has not been plucked forever,"" Patrisse Marie Cullors-Brignac, one of the co-founders of Black Lives Matter says. ""There is a network and a hashtag to gather around. It is powerful to be in alignment with our own people."" You can try, but it is hard to avoid the conversation about Black Lives Matter anymore. And that's exactly the point. But the group is also trying to find its footing to make much more change. And part of that means really figuring out what the movement is about, longer-term; where leaders think they can do more than demonstrate and disrupt society and ""shut sh*t down,"" as they often chant. They say it is about much more than each individual death of an African-American man or woman, it is about what it means to be black in America.  And that means learning how to make political change to address the frustrations of the African-American community. The movement wants a civil rights movement-type of change that shakes up politics and breaks the cycle of violence and silence. To do that, it also must confront itself, its leadership and how it plans to operate. The group does not have one prominent leader, and that is by design. ""We don't have a one strong leader model. You can't kill the movement by killing the leader because there are many,"" Cullors-Brignac says. ""But decentralization does not mean disorganization. We are highly organized."" Still there are those who have emerged as social media leaders, judging by their mass followings.  DeRay Mckesson is front and center, with 268,000 Twitter followers and counting. He drives conversation. He is poetic and polarizing all at once. He's been called everything from the new Martin Luther King Jr. to a devil intent on dividing America, depending on who is responding to him. Mckesson has been protesting in some form since the August 2014 police killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, which was eventually deemed justified by both a grand jury and a Department of Justice investigation. He is never absent from Twitter, where he skewers police accused in killings or brutality. He attacks police department tactics and the media, and his prominence keeps growing among those who hate him and those who support him. While he is vociferous at times, he knows that the movement is bigger than any single person, and he wants to keep it that way.  ""I think it's a movement of many people doing important work and leading in different ways. We've only begun to see the power and impact of that type of model,"" he said. Which is why social media is such a big part of how Black Lives Matter operates. Activists like Mckesson, Patrisse Marie Cullors-Brignac, Shaun King, Brittany Packnett, Johnetta Elzie and Samuel Sinyangwe make sure to use the platform as a bullhorn to share their message with the public and inspire others to take part. Protesting politicians, and maybe their allies    In the past 15 months, the movement has gone from local outrage in Ferguson to a tidal wave of awakening across the nation. ""We brought more people into the conversation, and they realized the problem is much closer to them than they think,"" Mckesson says. But the group's tactics have come under intense scrutiny, sometimes by the very people it is supporting or who have supported it. Some critics blame Black Lives Matter for worsening race relations in America, pointing to polls that show Americans think race relations are worse in recent years. But Black Lives Matter activists say just because they have pointed out racism in America, doesn't mean the group is to blame. The group is also known to take over at political rallies of the very people who could be allies in their fight.  When Black Lives Matter protesters interrupted Bernie Sanders at a campaign rally in Seattle in August, shouting their way onstage and later causing the Democratic presidential candidate to leave the event, some members distanced themselves, saying that didn't represent their agenda. But with the way the group has positioned itself, anyone with similar goals can consider themselves part of the group and movement.  Sanders' fellow Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was next, later that month. But this time, they wanted to make sure she heard them. So they pushed to get close and have a personal conversation about paying more attention to the group's goals.  Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump hasn't escaped their ire, but he did manage to talk over them partly because some of his supporters pushed out one of the protesters during a speech in Alabama.  But the focus also had to be on real areas they could change now with leaders currently in power. At an October town hall meeting in south Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti showed up intending to listen and respond to the community to restore a frayed relationship. What he encountered was Black Lives Matter activists who stood up and turned their backs on him.                              ""The mayor has neglected, disrespected and abused the black community for far too long,"" said Melina Abdullah, a Black Lives Matter organizer and professor of African studies, grabbing everyone's attention.                                                 While the crowd may have agreed with her, some were frustrated that members of the group had sideswiped their chance to have a serious conversation with the mayor. ""You have the subgroup trying to take over the town hall. Whatever they were talking about is not my reality,"" Daryle Shumake, a 45-year-old black health care worker, told the Los Angeles Times that night.  In Minneapolis, protesters occupied the police department to demand that video be released of the police shooting of 24-year-old Jamar Clark. The officers involved in the death are on administrative leave pending state and federal investigations. Black Lives Matters members continue to protest. Clark's family has been thankful for the activists' support but also frustrated at times with their tactics. Family members repeatedly appealed for peace, and respect for property, saying there's a fine line between protesting a cause and hurting the community. Later, the Black Lives Matter movement was the target of a shooting outside the police department and the family again urged them to leave, this time for the group's own safety.  ""Disagreements about tactics are totally normal. We have differing opinions. This happened during the 60s in the days of Martin Luther King, and the Black Panther movement,"" Cullors-Brignac says. ""It is just that our disagreements are often displayed to the public in real time on social media."" She openly worries that the infighting can be destructive, but it shouldn't take away from the work that needs to be done. Confronting violence and their path ahead The Black Lives Matter movement is making a concerted effort not to encourage violence. It responds fiercely when accused of committing violent acts during protests. But this comes with the territory with a loosely formed group. When you organize or encourage protests and encourage all to get involved, then the group itself and the movement bear the brunt of the blame if some become violent or destructive, as was the case in Ferguson and Baltimore. So, in Minneapolis, the activists took a different tack when they learned of a potential plot by white supremacists to incite violence to tarnish the movement. They told group members to make sure their faces could be seen, so fingers couldn't be pointed at them. When a male walking around the crowd was asked to remove his mask and refused, the group questioned why he was there. When he said he was just checking things out, they grabbed him by the arm and escorted him out.  ""Not today. You are not welcome to create chaos here. No sir,"" they said.  Again, some praised the group's actions, while others condemned them. They were trying to police themselves, but also removed someone from a public street. Police later discovered Molotov cocktails not far from the protest site, though they never figured out who was responsible.  The threats against the group itself are now fast and furious. Most are online. But some are in person. In Minneapolis, five demonstrators were shot. Police arrested three suspects, all of them white, after a confrontation between protesters and the men.  Despite the bumps, the hurdles and the accusations, the movement continues and grows across the country. The question is, what is the group's plan for the future and will it have an impact on policy, or will it just continue to make its presence known by protesting? ""In the beginning that was about awareness and recognition, helping bring attention to an issue,"" Mckesson said. He and Samuel Sinyangwe, Britanny Packnett and Johnetta Elzie came out with a policy of sorts -- or at least a clear and concise list of principles for policy change. They called it Campaign Zero, and they map out policy issues and have honed in on areas in which they think they can bring about real change: police contracts and misconduct records; investigations of police; community representation; ""militarization"" of police; use of body cameras.                                                                      Mckesson says the key to the group's future is to start getting involved in hyper-local politics not just national races. Taking to the streets will always be a part of the movement, but taking over as policy-makers could change things forever. ""What does it mean when protesters become city council members, mayors, school board members?"" Mckesson asked. ""How will that factor into the next phase? How will we grow and change? The movement has matured, for lack of a better word, but it has to be multifaceted."""," The rise of Black Lives Matter: Trying to break the cycle of violence and silence The term ""Black Lives Matter"" is often used to refer to a broad umbrella term that includes groups of people who are disproportionately affected by police brutality and racism. But ""Black Lives Matter"" has also been used to describe specific groups of people who are disproportionately affected by specific types of violence. For example, the term ""Black Lives Matter"" is used to describe people who are disproportionately affected by police brutality and racial discrimination. The rise of the Black Lives Matter movement and the shift in public opinion has led to a shift in how we think about these issues. Many people are now thinking about these issues in broader terms, and not just in terms of race or gender. For example, sociologists have found that the way that police officers perceive and respond to violence against them can have an impact on the way they view and respond to these issues. The shift in public opinion may also be a direct result of the protests and demonstrations that have taken place across the country and around the world. People are also thinking about these issues in terms of social justice. For example, one of the first things people did after the George Floyd police shooting was to start thinking about these issues in terms of social justice, says John Sommers, an associate professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ""We are seeing a shift in public opinion in a number of ways,"" Sommers says. ""For example, people are starting to think in terms of how the police are using the police power to exert control over people and communities."" In other words, the police are no longer seen as a monolith. In the past few weeks, more and more people have started to see police officers as partners in the fight against crime and terrorism. ""It is a very complex issue, and I don't want to get into the weeds,"" says Sommers. ""But we do know that police officers are often the first to respond to calls of a person who is mentally ill, or who is having a mental health crisis,"" he says. ""We do know that when police officers are involved in a fatal or serious incident, they often end up being the first to deploy lethal weapons. We do know that when police officers are killed, their families often don't get the information they need to know what happened."" The shift in public opinion could also be a result of a change in public perception of the police. People are also beginning to understand that the police are not always the best, Sommers says. ""I think we all need to be careful about what we say and do about police brutality, because that brutality could be the fuel for change,"" he says. ""And I think it would be dangerous if we just let the police off the hook.""
 For the past few weeks, the Black Lives Matter movement has been under fire from activists and politicians, who say it is hypocritical for the group to champion the rights of black people while also distancing itself from the actions of its own members. But the group says it's not about politics, it's about addressing the real issues that affect black people today. ""The Black Lives Matter movement is a statement of solidarity and commitment to the liberation of black people. It's not about politics. It's about putting our lives, our futures and our future children's lives at risk,"" said the group's national director, D.J. Wilson. ""The Black Lives Matter movement is not about the color of your skin, the color of your hair or the color of your skin as we all know it. It's about putting our lives, our futures and our children's futures at risk. The Black Lives Matter movement is not about the color of your skin, the color of your hair or the color of your skin as we all know it."" On Wednesday, the group plans to hold its first-ever national convention, Wilson said. It will be held at a local high school in the city of Columbus, the group said. The convention, which will be livestreamed and streamed, will feature speeches, panels and discussions on topics including police reform, criminal justice reform, education, housing, economic and social justice, according to a press release. ""The movement has been challenged in many ways over the past few years to speak truth to power, but we can't go back to the ways we were,"" the group said. ""The way we are going to get back to the way we were is with our actions."" 'We have to be clear about this' The group says it will use the convention to ""defend the right to peacefully assemble and protest."" ""We have to be clear about this: The Black Lives Matter movement is not a political organization. We are a civil rights organization. Our goal is to defend the rights of all people of color, not just some. We are not a political movement,"" the group said. ""We are a civil rights organization that stands for the liberation of all people. We are not a political organization that defends the rights",1023

Eight more people were arrested at the airport, CNN affiliate WCCO reported. In California, nine women were arrested for briefly shutting down an exit ramp on U.S. Highway 101 to San Francisco International Airport, according to the California Highway Patrol. ""CHP has moved all protestors off of the freeway. Travelers will make it to the airport on-time,"" CHP Capt. Christopher Sherry said on Twitter. ""There are many dangers associated with walking onto a busy freeway. There are also consequences that follow."" In Minnesota, Black Lives Matter activists formed a human chain and blocked roads to both terminals at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, bringing holiday travelers to a temporary standstill. Demonstrators also congregated inside Terminal 2, causing the federal Transportation Security Administration to shut down both security checkpoints there for 45 minutes, said Patrick Hogan, a spokesman for the Minneapolis airport. ""Protestors are departing the airport, and the situation here is slowly returning to normal. Some flights at Terminal 2 were delayed due to the fact that, with the security checkpoints closed, travelers couldn't get screened in order to get to their gates,"" Hogan said Wednesday afternoon. A mile away earlier in the day, scores of protesters assembled inside Minneapolis' Mall of America, but police in riot gear and mall security officers dispersed the crowd, pushing them outside the shopping center. Stores on the east side of the mall were closed Wednesday morning in expectation of the protest, two store managers told CNN. Customer traffic was also down Wednesday, they said. Some of the dispersed protesters left the mall and boarded trains to the airport, CNN affiliate WCCO reported. The airport had advised travelers to leave extra early because of the delays caused by protesters, the facility said on Twitter. The activist group Black Lives Matter had planned demonstrations in six U.S cities on Wednesday, which it was calling ""Black Xmas"" and a national day of action. The activists accuse police agencies nationwide of bias against the black community. ""Today, on one of the busiest days of the holiday season, black communities across the United States are taking brave actions to impede the flow of goods and commerce with peaceful protests to call for an immediate overhaul of the justice system both locally and nationally that will demand accountability for police, removal of grand juries in cases involving police shootings, an immediate halt to militarized police units and weapons, and extensive review of racialized police practices in black neighborhoods,"" the group said."," Black Lives Matter blocks roads to airports in Minneapolis, San Francisco, and Boston. In Minneapolis, protesters gathered in front of the governor's mansion. In Boston, a group of protesters blocked traffic on the Red Sox's Red Sox Stadium road to protest police brutality. The protest was peaceful. Here are the latest events: Protests spread across US Demonstrators in cities such as Chicago, Philadelphia, and New York have called for an end to police brutality and the need for reform. In New York City, more than 300 protesters have been arrested since the police killing of Eric Garner. In Chicago, hundreds of demonstrators are demanding a reclassification of some of the city's major crimes, including the use of force and racial profiling. The demonstrations have also spread to other cities including Los Angeles, Denver, Seattle and Houston. Protests spread to other continents Demonstrators are demanding a constitutional amendment to overturn Roe V. Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide. In Paris, hundreds of demonstrators, led by the Rev. Alain Juppe, shut down the main thoroughfare in the city center and briefly shut down the entire city's subway system. In New York City, hundreds of demonstrators, led by the Rev. Eric Barron, also shut down the subway. Protests spread to other countries Demonstrators in more than 20 countries marched in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter protests. The march was led by the Black Lives Matter-led Global March Against Racism and Imperialism, according to CNN.

 Police said that the officers involved in the shooting of Michael Brown were responding to a report that a man had broken car windows. The officers confronted Brown, who was fleeing, and shot him, police said. No charges have been filed in his death. But the controversy has revived the Black Lives Matter movement, with protests spreading across the country and calls for reform. The protests have been complicated by the death of Eric Garner, a 43-year-old black man who died after police attempted to arrest him for selling cigarettes illegally in Staten Island. Protesters have been calling for police reform since 2014. Last week, demonstrators in Dallas confronted police over a fatal shooting of another black man, Philando Castile.

93,https://www.cnn.com/2015/08/20/us/shaun-king-controversy/index.html, Black Lives Matter activist Shaun King addresses race reports," ""The reports about my race, about my past, and about the pain I've endured are all lies,"" wrote King, who blogs at the Daily Kos. ""I refuse to speak in detail about the nature of my mother's past, or her sexual partners, and I am gravely embarrassed to even be saying this now, but I have been told for most of my life that the white man on my birth certificate is not my biological father and that my actual biological father is a light-skinned black man,"" he said. King was answering allegations made this week by websites Breibart.com and the Daily Beast that claimed King's father is white. Breibart published what it says is King's Kentucky birth certificate, listing Jeffery Wayne King as the father, but the document doesn't list his race. The Daily Beast said public records it reviewed show that King's father is Caucasian.  Black Lives Matter -- the nationwide rallying cry of activists protesting the killing of unarmed black men by police -- is growing in the limelight and King has been at the center of it, appearing often on television talk shows and at protest sites. ""It is horrifying to me that my most personal information, for the most nefarious reasons, has been forced out into the open and that my private past and pain have been used as jokes and fodder to discredit me and the greater movement for justice in America,"" King wrote. A direct question CNN's Don Lemon exchanged text messages with King on Wednesday night and asked him directly whether he was black or white. ""Initially, he did not answer but later referred to himself as biracial,"" Lemon said. ""But then when I asked him if that's what it shows on his birth certificate I did not hear back from him. No answer on that."" King, in tweets with Lemon, said the various reports are all lies designed to discredit his cause. ""This attack isn't about me so much, but is about derailing Black Lives Matter and the movement against police brutality,"" he said. In one of a series of tweets Wednesday, King said, ""First off, the key facts about my biological relatives are all wrong. They tried, but my family, like many of yours, is one big mess."" King blasted Breibart, The Blaze, talk show host Glenn Beck and other conservatives, saying they don't care what color he is, they only want him to ""shut up."" He also compared his situation to President Obama's ""birther"" controversy. ""In essence, what is happening to me now, is like conservatives demanding Obama's long form birth certificate,"" he tweeted. On Thursday, King wrote: ""Never have I once identified myself as white. Not on forms, not for convenience or privilege, and not for fun and games, have I ever identified myself as white. I was never a white guy pretending to be black. Not once, ever, did it occur to me that I was being phony or fraudulent or fake."" Scholarship questions One of the allegations made against King is that he misrepresented himself to get a scholarship, financed by media mogul Oprah Winfrey, to get him through Morehouse College, the historically black college in Atlanta. King flatly denied these claims. ""To be clear, I received a full academic and leadership scholarship to attend Morehouse College based on my grades and my leadership skills,"" he wrote.  ""When I was forced to leave Morehouse to have yet another spinal surgery, I lost that scholarship and was then offered a scholarship from Oprah Winfrey when I returned to complete my studies. She wanted it to be for 'diamonds in the rough' and that was pretty much who I was at that point. I didn't apply for it. Nobody does. The college selects brothers who need it and I was, very gratefully, chosen for it,"" King said. Morehouse said Wednesday that it had ""no comment"" on the allegations against King, but added the college doesn't grant admissions or scholarships based on race.  A hate crime? Another charge against King is that he lied about being the victim of a hate crime 20 years ago when he was a high school student in Versailles, Kentucky. King said he was beaten by a ""racist mob of rednecks"" so badly that he missed almost two years of school while recovering from fractures to his face and ribs as well as severe injuries to his spine. A Forbes magazine profile called it ""one of the first registered hate crimes"" in Kentucky history. ""In March of 1995, it all boiled over and a racist mob of nearly a dozen students beat me severely, first punching me from all sides, then, when I cradled into a fetal position on the ground they stomped me mercilessly, some with steel-toed boots, for about 20 seconds,"" wrote King. ""I had fractures in my face and ribs, but most badly damaged was my spine. I ended up having three spinal surgeries and missed 20 months of school over it. My entire family endured this deeply painful time in my life ranging from the surgeries, the brutal recovery, physical therapy, and professional counseling. It was rougher than my words will ever do justice."" The Blaze disputes King's claims, citing police reports and witness statements that describe his injuries as minor and the incident as a fight between him and another person, not a beat down from a racist mob. The Blaze also reported that the FBI didn't have any record of hate crime incidents reported in Versailles in 1995. King's high school attack was racial, but it wasn't a hate crime, a family member told Lemon. King's family member said the cause of the altercation was about him being a white guy dating a black girl. King maintained on social media Wednesday that he was indeed the victim of a hate crime. Does it matter? If King is lying about his race, does it matter? Attorney and legal commentator Mel Robbins says it does because it becomes a distraction to Black Lives Matter. ""It matters because (there are conservatives) that would like to discredit the Black Lives Matter movement at all costs,"" she said. ""Every time somebody does this and they're not punished for it, it actually has a negative impact on the bigger movement."" CNN legal commentator Areva Martin agreed, saying the controversy is taking the focus off of the issues the Black Lives Matter movement cares about, like police brutality. And if King has been lying about his race, Martin said that's extremely harmful to Black Lives Matter. ""This movement cannot be sustained if you have leaders who are not credible,"" she said. ""The public is not tolerant of people who misrepresent themselves. You have to be who you say you are."" King sought to redirect attention away from questions about his race and toward his actual work. ""My work has never been about me and I've never made a big deal about my race. I've actually tried hard to avoid ever making a big deal out of it and have, instead, simply tried to do good work that matters. I'm eager to get back to the cause that concerns me most,"" he wrote."," Black Lives Matter activist Shaun King addresses race reports in a statement on his website. ""The Black Lives Matter movement is a serious and important movement, but it is not without its flaws. It is an incredibly effective tool for speaking out against systemic racism and police brutality, but it has also been accused of using the platform of activism to further their own agenda. This is a dangerous combination, and we cannot afford to lose sight of the fact that we are all and united by the same goal of speaking out against injustice and inequality. We need to be clear about that: the Black Lives Matter movement is NOT about race. It is not about race or ethnicity. It is about the people of color who have been systematically and unfairly targeted, killed, and maimed by police. It is about all of us who feel unsafe in our communities and the need for change that we are seeing in our nation's capital. It is about standing up for what is right and not being afraid to speak up and change the conversation. This is NOT a race issue. This is a movement issue. This is about the future of our democracy."" A Google search for ""Shaun King"" brings up more than 2,600 results. Among them is a video of an interview with CNN's Don Lemon, in which King said that the protests in Ferguson and New York City have been a ""good thing."" ""I think it's great that people are trying to make a difference, but I think that we've got to be careful what we wish for. We can't wish away the future of our democracy,"" King said. ""I think that Ferguson is one of the most powerful stories that's happening right now in the country, and we need to remember that. We need to remember that it's not just the young people who are being killed, it's the old people who are being killed. We need to remember that the young people are not the only ones who are affected. So it's really important that we keep trying to help those young people who are affected."" King's remarks come after he and other Black Lives Matter activists have been targeted for their views on race. In a recent interview with CNN's Don Lemon, King said that he felt that people who took to the streets to protest racism and police brutality were misusing the movement's resources. ""I think that the power of the Black Lives Matter movement is that it's able to shift the conversation to the real issues that are really happening right now. Because the real issues are, you know, the everyday issues that affect people of color, the issues that impact our world right now, and we need to talk about those issues in a way that's not divisive and that's not provocative,"" King said. ""I think that the power of the Black Lives Matter movement is that it's able to do that.""
 The statement from the group said the officers involved in the shooting were terminated and a disciplinary investigation was opened. ""The officers' actions were not consistent with the way we expect our nation's law enforcement officers to act,"" the statement said. ""They acted as though they were justified in the use of deadly force. They did not see the black teenager they were trying to arrest and they shot him in cold blood."" The statement said the officers involved in the shooting were terminated and a disciplinary investigation was opened. ""The officers involved in the shooting were terminated and a disciplinary investigation was opened,"" the statement said. The statement came after the parents of Trayvon Martin, who was shot and killed by George Zimmerman in 2012, demanded answers. ""Why did this happen to him?"" the family said in a statement. ""Why was he not charged?"" ""Why was he not indicted? Why wasn't he charged? Where is he now?"" Martin's parents said they wanted the public to know what happened and what they plan to do next. ""We want answers,"" said Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton. ""We want our son's case to be heard. We want justice. We want our son's family to know that we are not going to be silenced."" The police chief, Bill Evans, and the mayor of Sanford, Joe Riley, said they would release the names of the officers involved in the shooting. Evans said he wanted to protect the privacy of the officers involved. ""We have to do this in a manner that protects our community and our officers and we have to do it with the utmost care that we can,"" he said. Riley said he wanted to be transparent. ""We can't do this in a way that is going to give the wrong impression to the community,"" Riley said. ""We want to be clear about what happened and what we did and what we have to do to prevent this from happening again."" The protests have been mostly peaceful. But one man's death Saturday night has raised concerns among some that the demonstrations could turn violent. ""I think it's safe to say that there will be at least some incidents that occur in the city of Sanford, but the city is going to have a very tight grip on what happens in",1023

They held the protest Saturday against the Bloomington, Minnesota, mall's wishes, and were met by police who made at least 20 arrests, CNN affiliate KARE reported.  ""We are extremely disappointed that organizers of Black Lives Matter protest chose to ignore our stated policy and repeated reminders that political protests and demonstrations are not allowed on Mall of America property,"" AoM's said in a statement. The mall bills itself as the nation's largest with more than 500 businesses. It is big enough to hold seven Yankee Stadiums, its management boasts.  It is home to an indoor roller coaster, the Sea Life Aquarium, and about a dozen more attractions, but on Saturday amusement was drowned out by echoes of ""black lives matter"" and ""no justice, no peace.""  Marchers raised their hands in the air and lay down to play dead -- simulating the deaths of young black men Michael Brown of Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner, of New York, in confrontations with police. As protesters unfurled banners of ""hands up, don't shoot,"" the mall answered with a video wall message in all caps reading: ""This demonstration is not authorized and is in clear violation of Mall of America policy. We expect all participants to disperse at this time. Those who continue to demonstrate will be subject to arrest."" Management shut down the stores on one side of the mall. Officers called out to the crowd to leave, police spokesman Mark Stehlik told KARE. But officers seemed patient, giving protesters multiple chances to comply. ""They could have arrested me; they could have escorted me. They just asked me nicely to leave, and I did,"" said Michael McDowell, one of the protest organizers. Police then arrested some who were less willing to leave on their own, KARE reported. Prosecutors plan to throw the book at them.  ""They knowingly broke the law. They were involved in a situation that was very potentially dangerous,""  city prosecutor Sandra Johnson said."," Protesters' chants of 'Black Lives Matter' echo at megamall; at least 20 arrested   The demonstration was meant to protest police brutality and the death of Freddie Gray, an unarmed black man who died last month in police custody. The police department is under fire after the death of another unarmed black man, Michael Brown, in Ferguson, Missouri. Police have said Brown was not involved in the altercation that led to Gray's death. But a grand jury in Ferguson decided not to indict the officer involved in Gray's death.  The mood was tense at the rally. Some protesters carried Black Lives Matter flags. Others wore ""I can't breathe"" T-shirts. At one point, a man wielding a megaphone yelled, ""I can't breathe"" over and over. And at another, a man wearing a ""Black Lives Matter"" shirt was seen yelling, ""I can't breathe."" There were also reports of people in riot gear. But police said they did not use tear gas. The protests come amid a national debate on the use of police force and the role of race in society. The Police Department's use of tear gas in New York City during the first night of protests was criticized as a ""show of force."" Police in New York City used pepper spray against protesters. The city has ordered more than 200,000 rounds of tear gas. The protests have been largely peaceful. The mayor of Baltimore, which is hosting the 2022 Winter Olympics, said police presence ""will be minimal"" during the games. He also said he is ""hopeful"" that the protests will be a ""constructive"" part of the Games.
